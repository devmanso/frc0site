Branding is the process of creating a name, symbol, or design that identifies and differentiates a product from other products. A brand is in essence a promise to your customer. It tells them what they can expect from your products and services, and it differentiates your offering from that of your competitors. While in FRC we don't have "customers" per se, we do have sponsors and other stakeholders that we need to impress.
