## What is the Engineering Design Process?

![Design Process](/images/engineering_design/engDesignChart.png)

The engineering design process is a series of steps that engineers use to solve complex problems. The process can be applied to any problem, not just engineering problems. The process is iterative, meaning that it is repeated over and over again until the problem is solved. The process is also cyclical, meaning that the steps are repeated in a loop. The steps are:

1. **Identify the Problem**
2. **Research**
3. **Brainstorm**
4. **Create a Prototype**
5. **Test the Prototype**
6. **Communicate the Results**
7. **Repeat**
