The first step in the design process is to identify the problem. This is the most important step in the process. If you don't know what the problem is, you can't solve it. The problem should be clearly defined. It should be specific, and not too broad. It should also be measurable. This means that you should be able to know when the problem is solved. For example, if the problem is "I want to build a robot that can score points in the game", that is too broad. You need to be more specific. A better problem would be "I want to pick up a ball from the ground and score it in the high goal". This is a better problem because it is specific, and it is measurable. You can know when the problem is solved because you can score a ball in the high goal.

#### FRC Specific Problems

Every year we are given a new problem to solve. At first it can seem completely daunting and different from everything we've seen before. This however, is hardly true. Every year the game is a variation of the same problems. 

>**"How do we pickup and interact with objects, move across terrain and do some of that with the aid of sensors and feedback?"** 

This is the same problem we've been solving for years. The only difference is the specifics. The specifics are what make the game unique. The specifics are what make the game fun. The specifics are what make the game challenging. The specifics are what make the game exciting. The specifics are what make the game different. And while the specifics are what make the game unique, even those specifics are variations of the same problems we've been solving for years.

>**"How do we pickup a cone or cube at ground level and raise it to a height of 36 inches?"**

This is a specific problem question for the 2023 season. By just changing a few keywords we can use our first problem statement to put this new problem into perspective.

### Tips for Identifying the Problem

- **Read the Game Manual** - The game manual is a great resource for identifying the problem. It includes robot construction rules, game rules and scoring. While FRC isn't all about winning, the points are how teams are ranked. Therefore it's best to try and solve the problems that will get you the most points. The game manual will tell you what those problems are.
- **Talk to your Teammates** - Your teammates are a great resource for identifying the problem. They can help you think of problems that you may not have thought of. They can also help you think of solutions to the problems you've identified. They can also help you think of ways to solve the problems that you've identified.
- **Watch the Game Animation** - The game animation is a great resource for identifying the problem. It shows you how the game will be played. It shows you how the game pieces will look like, how they are scored and what some of the strategies will be.
- **Check Social Media** - FRC specific social media like the discord, subreddit and chief delphi forums are great resources for connecting with other teams on the same problem. Everyone is working on the same problems and while it is a competition and it's important to learn how to do things for yourself, asking others for help is always an option! Teams are always willing to help other teams and share their knowledge.
- **Watch the Ri3D Broadcasts** - The Ri3D broadcasts are a great resource for identifying the problem. They (Alumni) attempt to make a game specific robot in 72 hours (3 days). They live stream lots of the process, answer questions and share their knowledge.

### Next Steps

Now that you've identified the problem, it's time to [research](/engineering_design/design_process/research_the_problem/) the problem!
