# 9.0 Outreach & Education

Outreach and education are important parts of the FIRST experience. Outreach is the process of sharing your team's experience with others. Education is the process of learning about FIRST and the FIRST Robotics Competition and STEM. Outreach and education are important because they help to grow the FIRST community. The more people that are involved in FIRST, the more people that will be inspired to pursue STEM careers. The more people that are inspired to pursue STEM careers, the more people that will be able to solve the world's problems. There are many ways to get involved in outreach and education. If you would like to get involved, talk to your team mentor or team leadership. For a direct way to get involved, check out the [FIRST Volunteer Portal](https://my.usfirst.org/volunteer/) or submit content here to the FRC0 website for others to learn from too!

Below is an outline of the topics that will be covered in this chapter.
