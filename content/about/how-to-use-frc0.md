FRC0 is based on the learn theme for Hugo. The learn theme is explained in detail on the [Hugo Learn Theme](https://learn.netlify.app/en/) website. What is useful about this theme is it uses a system of Chapters and Sections. Each Chapter is a topic and each Section is a sub-topic. The Chapters and Sections are listed in the left sidebar. The Chapters and Sections are also used to create the Table of Contents for each Chapter page. Below is a table of all of the chapters as of 2/5/2023:

| Order | Chapter Title |
| --- | --- |
| 0.0 | [About FRC0](/about/) |
| 1.0 | [Competition](/competition/) |
| 2.0 | [Engineering Design](/engineering_design/) |
| 3.0 | [Machining & Fabrication](/machining_fab/) |
| 4.0 | [Electronics](/electronics/) |
| 5.0 | [Pneumatics](/pneumatics/) |
| 6.0 | [Programming](/programming/) |
| 7.0 | [Computer Aid Design](/cad/) |
| 8.0 | [Business & Marketing](/business_marketing/) |
| 9.0 | [Outreach & Education](/outreach_education/) |

Contents are divided into numbered sections to help with the ordering of the menu. There is also a weight property that can be added to the front matter of each page to help with ordering. As a reminder the front matter is the section of the page that starts with `---` and ends with `---`. The front matter is used to set the page title, date, and other properties. The front matter is explained in detail on the [Hugo Front Matter](https://gohugo.io/content-management/front-matter/) page.

Another awesome benefit of the learn theme is the FREE search tool! Its located at the top of the left sidebar. Any topics, keywords, etc. can be searched for. If you are unsure where to find a piece of information, try searching for it. 

### Disclaimers and Other Legal Profunctory Stuff
FRCzero.org is not an official source of information for FIRST Robotics Competition. It is a knowledge base for students, mentors, and parents of FIRST Robotics Competition teams. It is written by those same students, mentors, and parents. Humans, if you may not know, are rarely perfect and have been known to make occasional mistakes. A famous human inventor once said, "I have not failed. I've just found 10,000 ways that won't work." So, if you find a mistake, please let us know. We will do our best to fix it. You can submit issues to the github repository and you can submit a pull request to fix the issue. If you find the idea of github confusing, you should ask a mentor or FRC community member for help. A very good beginners guide to using git and github can be found at [https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/).

FRCzero.org is a non-official, non-licensed, uninsured, community of it's users.
