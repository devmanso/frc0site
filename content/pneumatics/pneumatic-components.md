Pneumatic components are the parts of a pneumatic system that use compressed air to do work. There are many different types of pneumatic components. The most common pneumatic components are shown in the table below:

| Component | Description | Image | Vendor Link(s) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Solenoid | A solenoid is a valve that uses an electric current to open and close. It is used to control the flow of air in a pneumatic system. Solenoids can be 12v or 24v. There is a jumper on the PCM for this and it sets the voltage level for ALL solenoids attached to it. The solenoids are marked for which voltage level they are meant to work with.| ![Solenoid](/images/pneumatics/solenoid.jpg) | [Andymark](https://www.andymark.com/products/ckd-single-solenoid-valve-standalone?via=Z2lkOi8vYW5keW1hcmsvV29ya2FyZWE6OkNhdGFsb2c6OkNhdGVnb3J5LzViZDM0MWUzNjFhMTBkMjkyYzk2NDY2Zg) |
| Double Solenoid | A double solenoid is a valve that uses an electric current to open and close. It is used to control the flow of air in a pneumatic system. It has two ports, one for air in and one for air out. Solenoids of both kinds are usually attached to manifold| ![Double Solenoid](/images/pneumatics/double-solenoid.jpg) | [Andymark](https://www.andymark.com/products/ckd-double-solenoid-valve-2-position) |
| Compressor | A compressor is a device that uses an electric motor to compress air. It is used to provide the air pressure for a pneumatic system. Teams can prefill tanks with an offboard compressor board. It must still use the PCM as its controlling hardware. | ![Compressor](/images/pneumatics/compressor.jpg) | [Andymark](https://www.andymark.com/products/air-compressor?via=Z2lkOi8vYW5keW1hcmsvV29ya2FyZWE6OkNhdGFsb2c6OkNhdGVnb3J5LzViZWMyZjYwNjFhMTBkM2RiNDYxOGRmYg) |
| Pneumatic Cylinder | A pneumatic cylinder is a device that uses compressed air to extend and retract a piston. These can come in a wide variety of sizes and shapes. | ![Pneumatic Cylinder](/images/pneumatics/pneumatic-cylinder.jpg) | [Andymark](https://www.andymark.com/categories/pneumatics-cylinders) |
| Pneumatic Tank | A pneumatic tank is a device that stores compressed air. They don't all have to be plastic. There is not a limit on the capacity of your tanks, however they must be rated for higher than 125 PSI| ![Pneumatic Tank](/images/pneumatics/pneumatic-tank.jpg) | [Andymark](https://www.andymark.com/products/590-ml-air-reservoir-with-1-4-in-npt-ports?via=Z2lkOi8vYW5keW1hcmsvV29ya2FyZWE6OkNhdGFsb2c6OkNhdGVnb3J5LzViYzRhMmZmNjFhMTBkNGQyZTU4OGU0OA)|
| Pneumatic Fitting | A pneumatic fitting is a device that connects two pneumatic components together. Fittings can come in many different styles. There are splitters, T taps, and more!| ![Pneumatic Fitting](/images/pneumatics/pneumatic-fitting.jpg) | [Andymark](https://www.andymark.com/categories/pneumatics-fittings) |
| Pneumatic Hose | A pneumatic hose is a device that carries compressed air from one component to another. These can come in a variety of colors and styles. All of the ones for FRC are 1/4 inch in diameter.| ![Pneumatic Hose](/images/pneumatics/pneumatic-hose.jpg) | [Andymark](https://www.andymark.com/products/20-meters-of-pneumatic-tubing-1-4-in-od-polyurethane-black?via=Z2lkOi8vYW5keW1hcmsvV29ya2FyZWE6OkNhdGFsb2c6OkNhdGVnb3J5LzViZWMyZjYwNjFhMTBkM2RiNDYxOGRmYg) |
| Pressure Release Valve | A pressure release valve is a device that releases air pressure from a pneumatic system. There are several types of these used in FRC. There are levers, spring pulls and more. As long as it can safely vent air in a hurry!| ![Pressure Release Valve](/images/pneumatics/pressure-release-valve.jpg) | [Andymark](https://www.andymark.com/products/pressure-gauge-1-5-face-back-mount-1-8-npt-0-160-psi?via=Z2lkOi8vYW5keW1hcmsvV29ya2FyZWE6OkNhdGFsb2c6OkNhdGVnb3J5LzViZWMyZjYwNjFhMTBkM2RiNDYxOGRmYg)|
| Pressure Switch | A pressure switch is a device that detects when the air pressure in a pneumatic system is above or below a certain value. | ![Pressure Switch](/images/pneumatics/pressure-switch.jpg) | [Andymark](https://www.andymark.com/products/nason-pressure-switch?via=Z2lkOi8vYW5keW1hcmsvV29ya2FyZWE6OkNhdGFsb2c6OkNhdGVnb3J5LzViZWMyZjYwNjFhMTBkM2RiNDYxOGRmYg) |
| Pressure Gauge | A pressure gauge is a device that displays the air pressure in a pneumatic system. | ![Pressure Gauge](/images/pneumatics/pressure-gauge.jpg) | [Andymark](https://www.andymark.com/products/pressure-gauge-1-8-in-npt-0-160-psi-1?via=Z2lkOi8vYW5keW1hcmsvV29ya2FyZWE6OkNhdGFsb2c6OkNhdGVnb3J5LzViZWMyZjYwNjFhMTBkM2RiNDYxOGRmYg) |
| Analog Pressure Sensor | An analog pressure sensor is a device that converts the air pressure in a pneumatic system into an analog voltage. | ![Analog Pressure Sensor](/images/pneumatics/analog-pressure-sensor.jpg) | [Andymark](https://www.andymark.com/products/analog-pressure-sensor?via=Z2lkOi8vYW5keW1hcmsvV29ya2FyZWE6OkNhdGFsb2c6OkNhdGVnb3J5LzViZWMyZjYwNjFhMTBkM2RiNDYxOGRmYg) |
| Pressure Regulator | A pressure regulator is a device that controls the air pressure in a pneumatic system. | ![Pressure Regulator](/images/pneumatics/pressure-regulator.jpg) | [Andymark](https://www.andymark.com/products/pressure-regulator-gauge-with-1-4-in-press-in-tube-fittings?via=Z2lkOi8vYW5keW1hcmsvV29ya2FyZWE6OkNhdGFsb2c6OkNhdGVnb3J5LzViZWMyZjYwNjFhMTBkM2RiNDYxOGRmYg)|
| Pneumatic Control Module | A pneumatic control module is a device that controls the air pressure in a pneumatic system. | ![Pneumatic Control Module](/images/pneumatics/pneumatic-control-module.jpg) |[CTRE](https://store.ctr-electronics.com/pneumatic-control-module/), [Andymark](https://www.andymark.com/products/pneumatic-control-module?via=Z2lkOi8vYW5keW1hcmsvV29ya2FyZWE6OkNhdGFsb2c6OkNhdGVnb3J5LzViZWMyZjYwNjFhMTBkM2RiNDYxOGRmYg) |
| Pneumatic Hub | The Pneumatic Hub features 16 solenoid channels which allow for up to 16 single-acting solenoids, 8 double-acting solenoids, or a combination of the two types. | ![Pneumatic Hub](/images/pneumatics/pneumatic-hub.webp) | [REV](https://www.revrobotics.com/rev-11-1852/) |
