Pneumatics are powerful and can be dangerous if not used properly. This section will cover the safety rules and guidelines for pneumatics. As is the case with all safety rules, they are not meant to be restrictive. They are meant to be guidelines to help keep you safe. If you have any questions about the safety rules, please ask your mentor or coach.

## Safety Rules

1. Never use compressed air to propel a projectile.
2. Never apply compressed air to the skin or direct it at a person. Even air at a pressure of 15 psig can cause serious
injury. Never use a compressed air hose to clean dirt or dust from your clothing or body.
3. Always wear safety glasses when working with pneumatics.
4. Always check for humans and other objects in the path of the pistons, air, system, before turning on the compressor.
5. Never turn on the compressor WITHOUT the pressure switch connected.
6. Make sure that the release valve is open before turning on the compressor during initial setup.
7. Wear ear protection. Exposure to excessive noise can damage hearing. Noise reducing mufflers can be fitted to
machines to lessen the noise health hazard.
8. Never use frayed, damaged or deteriorated hoses. Always store hoses properly and away from heat sources or direct
sunlight. A hose failure can cause serious injury. Hose Reels can decrease your chances of injury, as well as help hoses
last longer. 

## Potential Hazards

- Tank Shattering
- Hearing Damage (Loud Compressor)
- Solenoid Failure (Misfiring mechanism)
- PCM Failure (Lack of control or Pressure Feedback)
- Air Leak (This can force hoses to slip off fittings)
