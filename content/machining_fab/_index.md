# 3.0 Machining & Fabrication

There are many levels and types of machining and fabrication. The most common types of machining are turning and milling. Turning is the process of cutting a cylindrical shape into a piece of material. Milling is the process of cutting a flat shape into a piece of material. The most common types of fabrication are welding and 3D printing. Welding is the process of joining two pieces of metal together. 3D printing is the process of building a 3D object from a digital model. Teams without equipment like this can still benefit from the lessons in this chapter. Teams can learn how to make parts using other methods like hand tools and simple machines. Teams will also get advice on how to find new tools, access to mentors/shops, and how to use the tools they have. The lessons about machining and fabrication apply to all levels of teams. Teams can learn how to use the tools they have to make the best parts they can.

Below is an outline of the topics that will be covered in this chapter.
