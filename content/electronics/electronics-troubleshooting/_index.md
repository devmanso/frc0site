### What is Electronics Troubleshooting?

Electronics troubleshooting is the process of finding and fixing problems with electronic circuits. This process is very similar to troubleshooting mechanical problems. You will need to use the same steps to find and fix problems with electronics. The only difference is that you will be using electronic tools and equipment to find and fix the problems. Motors and other sensors are also considered electronics. This means that you will also need to troubleshoot these components.

Below is an outline of the topics that will be covered in this section.
