# 4.0 Electronics

Electronics is the backbone of the robot. Without electronics, the robot would not be able to move, sense, or communicate. Electronics is the most complex part of the robot. Students will learn how to design, document, assemble, and test electronic circuits. Students will also learn how to use the tools and equipment needed to build these circuits. There are many different types of electronics that can be used on a robot. Some of these include:

- Motors
- Sensors
- Relays
- Switches
- Lights
- Cameras
- Microcontrollers
- Power Distribution
- HMIs (Human Machine Interfaces)
- Communication Hardware

Below is an outline of the topics that will be covered in this chapter.
