### Multimeter

A multimeter is a device that measures voltage, current, and resistance. A multimeter is a very useful tool for troubleshooting electronics. Many teams use this tool to check Battery Voltage before each and every match! It can also be used to check continuity, which is also very handy for troubleshooting electrical problems. Every multimeter is different, but most multimeters have the following features:

- Voltage
- Current
- Resistance
- Continuity
- Diode
- Capacitance
- Frequency
- Temperature

SparkFun has a great tutorial on how to use a multimeter. You can find it [here](https://sparkfuneducation.com/how-to/multimeter.html).

### Wire Strippers

There are so many styles of wire strippers, but they all do the same thing. Wire strippers are used to strip wires. The style choices after that are for convenience. Some wire strippers have a built in crimper, some have a built in cutter, and some have both. The most common wire strippers are the ones that have a built in crimper. These are the ones that we recommend for basic FRC use.

The first two sets of wire strippers are the ones that we recommend. The last two sets of wire strippers are not recommended because they are not easy to use, are frustrating in a hurry and students have struggled with them in the past. If you have a set of wire strippers that are not in the first two pictures, there is nothing wrong with them. They are just not recommended by FRC Zero since they are not easy to use in most cases.

When using any wire strippers it is important to take into account the wire gauge. The wire gauge is the thickness of the wire. The thicker the wire, the more difficult it is to strip. The wire gauge is measured in AWG (American Wire Gauge). The higher the AWG number, the thinner the wire. The lower the AWG number, the thicker the wire. The strippers can also have a designated size difference for stranded versus solid core wires.

You should also keep in mind the length of the wire that you are stripping. How big is the connector that you are stripping the wire for? If you are stripping a wire for a connector that is 1/4" long, you will not need to strip as much wire as you would if you were stripping a wire for a connector that is 1" long. The longer the connector, the more wire you will need to strip. Wago Lever Nuts show a proper strip length on the side of the connector.

### Hot Air Gun

A hot air gun is a tool that is used to commonly shrink heat shrink tubing. It can also be used to heat up solder joints to make them easier to remove. Teams with a Pigeon IMU use it to heat up the Gyroscope during the calibration process. This can be a versatile tool, but also a very dangerous tool. It is important to follow all safety precautions when using a hot air gun. The hot air gun should be used in a well ventilated area. Fumes can come from unexpected sources when you add heat to anything.

### Crimpers

Just like wire strippers, there are so many styles of wire crimpers. Wire crimpers are used to crimp connectors of all kinds. The style will depend completely on the connectors you are using. The most common wire crimps can be done with the first pair of wire strippers we showed you. The first pair of wire strippers has a built in crimper. It is color coded to match the connector size. Typically the following colors are used:

- Red = 22-18 AWG
- Blue = 16-14 AWG
- Yellow = 12-10 AWG

### Anderson Powerpole Crimper

Anderson Powerpole Crimpers are used to crimp Anderson Powerpole connectors. These connectors are used to form a quick connection between two wires. They come in a wide variety of sizes and teams are given a full catalog in their kickoff kit. The Anderson Powerpole Crimpers are size by how many amps they can handle. The higher the amp rating, the more larger the internal connector piece is, but the outer connector may be the same size. The Anderson Powerpole Crimpers have slots for 15, 30 and 45 amp connectors.

The Anderson connectors can be a little tricky to get used to, but once you get the hang of them, they are very easy to use. There is a great explainer from [Powerwerx](https://powerwerx.com/help/powerpole-connectors#crimping) that goes over how to use the Anderson Powerpole Crimpers and also [assemble the connectors](https://powerwerx.com/help/powerpole-connectors#assembly).

### Ferrule Crimper

Ferrule Crimpers are used to crimp ferrules onto wires. Ferrules are used to connect wires to terminals. They are typically used on the end of a wire to connect to a terminal. A ferrule in simple terms is a metal tube that is crimped onto the end of a wire. The ferrule is better than raw wire because it is more durable and it is easier to connect to a terminal. The ferrule crimps are color coded to match the wire gauge. The following colors are typically used:

- Orange = 20 AWG
- White = 18 AWG
- Red = 16 AWG

The Ferrule Crimpers look like this:

![Ferrule Crimpers](https://cdn11.bigcommerce.com/s-7cuph2j78p/images/stencil/1280x1280/products/122/501/crimp4__69484.1623362277.png?c=1)

In FRC the ferrules get the most usage in connecting the RoboRIO's power lines to the PDP, and for any Weidmueller connectors that are used. An example of a Weidmueller connector with ferrules is the [CAN Connector](https://store.ctr-electronics.com/can-connector-5-pack/).

### Soldering Iron

A soldering iron is a tool that is used to melt solder onto a joint. A joint is any place where two wires, legs of a components, or any other two pieces of metal are connected. When soldering components and wires for electrical usage, we use thinner gauge solder. When soldering components and wires for mechanical usage, we use thicker gauge solder. Adafruit has a great [guide](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-guide-excellent-soldering) on soldering that we recommend you read.

![Soldering Iron](https://cdn-learn.adafruit.com/assets/assets/000/001/983/original/tools_Hakko_Fx88.jpg?1396778007)

A brief overview of the steps to connect two wires with solder is as follows:

1. Strip the wire to expose the copper
2. Twist the two wires together ![https://workmanship.nasa.gov/lib/insp/2%20books/links/sections/graphics/407/407-17.gif](https://workmanship.nasa.gov/lib/insp/2%20books/links/sections/graphics/407/407-17.gif)
    1. NASA has a recommended splice method that we recommend you use. You can find it [here](https://workmanship.nasa.gov/lib/insp/2%20books/links/sections/407%20Splices.html).
3. Heat the soldering iron tip
4. Place the soldering iron tip on the connection point of the two wires
5. Apply solder to the wires, the solder will melt and flow across the connection point
6. Remove the soldering iron tip and allow the solder to cool
7. Repeat steps 3-6 until the solder has formed a good connection
8. Add heat shrink tubing to the connection point
9. Shrink the heat shrink tubing
