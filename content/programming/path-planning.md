## What is Path Planning?

Path planning is the process of creating a path for your robot to follow. This path is usually created using a program called PathWeaver, a program that allows you to create autonomus paths for your robot.

## Getting Started

To get started with PathWeaver, you must first download it from the [FRC Game Tools](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/getting-started/getting-started-frc-control-system/wpilib-setup.html#frc-game-tools) page. Once you have downloaded PathWeaver, you can open it by going to the start menu and searching for "PathWeaver". Once you have opened PathWeaver, you will see the following screen:

Once you have downloaded System ID, you can open it by going to the start menu and searching for "System ID". Once you have opened System ID, you will see the following screen:

Once you have connected your robot to your computer, you can open System ID. Once you have opened System ID, you will see the following screen:
