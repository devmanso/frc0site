## What is C++ (C plus plus)

C++ is a general-purpose programming language created by Bjarne Stroustrup as an extension of the C programming language, or "C with Classes". The language has expanded significantly over time, and modern C++ now has object-oriented, generic, and functional features in addition to facilities for low-level memory manipulation. 

In simple terms, C++ is a programming languages that is used for a wide variety of purposes. It is used to create operating systems, games, browsers, and so much more. It is a very powerful language that is used by many programmers. In FRC, C++ can be used to program the robot, and it is one that other teams will be likely to help debug at your events. It is different from Java, python and LabView and each has its own advantages and disadvantages. We try to use FRC or robotics concepts as much as possible in the following lessons, but we also try to keep the examples as general as possible so that you can apply them to other projects so I will use FRC algorithms and examples but not use actual libraries or structure for TimedRobot, CommandBased or other types. Those are covered in other areas of the site.

Below is a table outlining the topics you will learn about in this section specifically for C++.
