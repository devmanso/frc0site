# 1.0 Competition

Competition is what brings every team together. The time when all the hard work pays off. The time when you get to show off your robot and your team. The time when you get to compete against other teams. The time when you get to have fun. The time when you get to win. The time when you get to lose. The time when you get to learn. The time when you get to grow. The time when you get to make friends. The time when you get to make memories. The time when you get to be a part of something bigger than yourself. The time when you get to be a part of a FIRST Robotics Competition.

FIRST is always, and will always be about more than the wins, losses and points on the field. It is about the students. It is about the teams. It is about the community. FRC and the other programs offered by FIRST have fostered the community behind this site. The experiences we have had at competitions have shaped us into the people we are today. We have made friends, learned lessons, and grown as people. We have made memories that will last a lifetime. We have been a part of something bigger than ourselves. We have been a part of a FIRST Robotics Competition.

Below is an outline of the topics that will be covered in this chapter.
