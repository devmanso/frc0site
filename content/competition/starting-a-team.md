This is a video produced by [FRC team 573](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZ9Z9Z9Z9Z9) that gives some more info.

Now that you're a little bit more aware of what FIRST Robotics Competition is, you may be interested in starting a team. This page will give you a brief overview of what it takes to start a team., what supplies you need, and how to get started. If you're interested in starting a team, you should also check out the [FIRST Robotics Competition Team Starter Guide](https://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/FRC/start-a-team).

#### The following advice is from FRC 2945 and their mentors. This was part of a Chief Delphi post [here](https://www.chiefdelphi.com/t/continuing-a-frc-team/430979/2) and used with permission!

> If you are directly affiliated with a school or a school district, see if your high school administration(s) will allow you to have demonstrations after your competition season or during your preseason. Those events are a great way to get interested parties in. Bring the robot, a way to control it, and an electronic signup sheet (like a Google Forms). Even if you aren’t directly affiliated with a school or a district, this is the best way to grow the student population of your team.

> To gain more mentors, recruit parents or use the FIRST Mentor Network on the FIRST site. If any teachers happen to pop into your demonstration, talk to them and try to enroll them into the team. Most of our mentors right now on our team are either current or former parents (Mentor OP is an alum of the team).

> To keep that knowledge base built, have the seniors do documentation about what they’ve done in each system. My team still needs to do a better job of this, but having a starting place for new students to learn from is a great way to get those new students involved. Just adding students doesn’t do much if they aren’t engaged in the team

### What Are Some Things to Consider When Starting a Team?

There are many things to consider when starting a team. Some of the most important things to consider are:

* How many students do you want to have on the team?
* How many mentors do you want to have on the team?
* How much time can members dedicate to the team?
* How much money can the team raise?
* How much space do you have to work in?
* Is the space you have to work in safe?
* Can you afford unexpected costs?
* Do you have a sustainable plan for the team?
* Do you have the backing of your school administration or another organization?

### Who Can Start a Team?

Anyone can start a team! Students can start a team, teachers can start a team, parents can start a team, and mentors can start a team. The only requirement is that you have at least two adult mentors who are willing to help you start a team. You'll also need some students, tools, space, funds for registration, and a lot of time. However, if you're willing to put in the time and effort, it is absolutely worth it!

### What Are the Costs?

The costs of starting a team vary from team to team. The costs can be broken down into two categories: registration fees and team expenses. Registration fees are the fees that FIRST charges to register a team. These fees are paid to FIRST and are used to cover the costs of running the FIRST Robotics Competition. Team expenses are the costs that the team incurs to build and maintain the robot, cover travel and other expenses. The two types of costs are separated for one main reason. The registration fees are a known item year after year. The other team expenses can vary wildly depending on your teams part inventory, new tool purchases and more. Below is a table that breaks down some of the costs associated with starting a team.

| Cost Title | Description | Importance Rating (low = 1, high = 10) | Cost ($) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Registration Fees | The fees that FIRST charges to register a team. These fees are paid to FIRST and are used to cover the costs of running the FIRST Robotics Competition. | 10 | 6,000 (recently changed from 5,000) |
| New Parts | The parts that you need to build a new robot. | 8 | 1,000 - 5,000 |
| New Tools | The tools that you need to build a new robot. | 8 | 400 - 2,000 |
| Hotels (not required always) | The cost of hotels for the team. | 5 | 1,000 - 3,000 |
| Food, Gas, Busses, etc. | The cost of food, gas, busses, etc. for the team (whole season). | 5 | 1,000 - 3,000 |
| Team Shirts, Banners, etc. | The cost of team shirts, banners, etc. | 5 | 200 - 800 |
| Maintenance | The cost of maintaining the robots basic parts year after year. | 5 | 200 - 1,000 |
| Miscellaneous | The cost of miscellaneous items. Pit Display Props, Mascot Costume, Extra robots or practice field | 5 | varies wildly |

### What Are Some Ways Teams Raise Money?

There are many ways that teams raise money. Some of the most common ways are:

* Fundraisers
* Donations
* Sponsors
* Grants

### What Are Some Ways to Find Sponsors?

There are many ways to find sponsors. Some of the most common ways are:

* Ask local businesses
* Ask parents and friends of students, teachers, and mentors
* Ask other teams
* Reach out to your Local FIRST Robotics Competition District
* Speak to your local Chamber of Commerce or Government offices
* Reach out to your local media outlets

### What Are Some Ways to Find Mentors?

There are many ways to find mentors. Some of the most common ways are:

* Ask local businesses
* Ask parents and friends of students, teachers, and mentors
* Ask other teams
* Reach out to your Local FIRST Robotics Competition District
* Speak to your local Chamber of Commerce or Government offices
* Reach out to your local media outlets
* Ask your school administration

### What Are Some Ways to Find Students?

There are many ways to find students. Some of the most common ways are:

* Do show and tell at your school
* Ask other teams to demonstrate their robots
* Attend local events as a field trip and talk to students on teams
* Put up posters around your school for recruitment
* Have announcements made over the school intercom
* Create a sign up sheet for students to sign up for the team and get their contact information

### What Are Some Ways to Find a Space to Work?

There are many ways to find a space to work. Some of the most common ways are:

* Ask your school administration
* Ask local businesses
* Ask other teams (Some teams are willing to let other teams use their space or even alternate between teams on a daily basis)
* Reach out to your Local FIRST Robotics Competition District
* Think about how you can use your school's space (i.e. a classroom, a gym, a cafeteria, etc.)
* Think about how you can use your community's space (i.e. a church, a community center, a library, etc.)

You may need less space than you think. You can use a classroom, a gym, a cafeteria, a church, a community center, a library, etc. You can also use a combination of spaces. For example, you can use a classroom for meetings and a gym for testing the robot. You could use a common area for team meals and a 2nd classroom with computers for CAD and code. Theres lots of ways to work around space issues. However, you should think about what type of work you plan to do and the rules the space allows. You probably shouldn't use a space that doesn't allow you to use power tools or that doesn't allow you to easily clean up after yourself.
