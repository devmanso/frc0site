## What is FRC0?

FRC0 is a website for FIRST Robotics Competition teams and mentors to share their knowledge and experience with other teams. It is a place to find information about the FRC game, build season, and competition season. It is also a place to find information about the FRC program in general, such as how to start a team, how to run a team, and how to run a competition. The website is open source and is hosted by [Mr. Siefen's Robot Emporium](https://mrsiefensrobotemporium.com). Anyone can contribute to the website by adding new content or editing existing content.

## Why did we create this website?

There is a lot of information about the FRC program, and it can be hard to find the information that you need. We hope that this website will make it easier for teams and mentors to find the information that they need. There are also teams who don't know where to even start googling for information. We hope that this website will help them find the information that they need.

## How can teams and mentors add new content?

STEP 1: Read the guide [here](https://FRCzero.org/about/writing-content/) it covers most of this!

Teams and mentors can add new content by creating a new markdown file in the appropriate folder. The website is hosted on GitHub, so you will need a GitHub account to contribute to the website.

Once you have added content to the file, you can save the file by clicking the "Commit new file" button.

## What are some tips and tricks for working with markdown?

Markdown is a simple markup language that is used to format text. You can learn more about markdown at [daringfireball.net/projects/markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown). Here are some tips and tricks for working with markdown:

- You can add a header to a markdown file by adding a number of `#` symbols before the header text. The more `#` symbols you add, the smaller the header will be. For example, `# Header 1` will create a large header, `## Header 2` will create a medium header, and `### Header 3` will create a small header.
- You can add a link to a markdown file by adding the link text in square brackets and the link in parentheses. For example, `[FRC Zero](https://FRCzero.org)` will create a link to the website.
- You can add an image to a markdown file by adding the image text in square brackets and the image in parentheses. For example, `![FRC zero logo](https://FRCzero.org/images/FRCZero.png)` will add an image to the file.
- You can add a list to a markdown file by adding a number of `-` symbols before the list item. For example, `- List item 1` will create a list item, `- List item 2` will create a list item, and `- List item 3` will create a list item.
- You can add a table to a markdown file by adding a number of `|` symbols before the table item. For example, `| Table item 1 | Table item 2 | Table item 3 |` will create a table item, `| Table item 4 | Table item 5 | Table item 6 |` will create a table item, and `| Table item 7 | Table item 8 | Table item 9 |` will create a table item.
- You can add a code block to a markdown file by adding a number of backticks before and after the code block. For example, `` `Code block` `` will create a code block.
- You can add a quote to a markdown file by adding a number of `>` symbols before the quote. For example, `> Quote` will create a quote.
- You can add bold text to a markdown file by adding a number of `**` symbols before and after the bold text. For example, `**Bold text**` will create bold text.
- You can add italic text to a markdown file by adding a number of `*` symbols before and after the italic text. For example, `*Italic text*` will create italic text.
- You can add strikethrough text to a markdown file by adding a number of `~~` symbols before and after the strikethrough text. For example, `~~Strikethrough text~~` will create strikethrough text.
- You can add inline code to a markdown file by adding a number of backticks before and after the inline code. For example, `` `Inline code` `` will create inline code.
