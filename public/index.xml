      <description>What is a Brand? In the context of FRC the team&amp;rsquo;s brand can include its name, logo, and other visual elements. These elements are used to create a consistent look and feel for the team. By planning ahead, creating styling guides and more, the team can create a brand that is easily recognizable and memorable. It&amp;rsquo;s also easy to create new content that fits within the brand.
New members to your business and marketing team can make new content Day one and already have their templates and branding guidelines to follow.</description>

      <title>2.1.1 Identify the Problem</title>
      <link>https://frczero.org/engineering_design/design_process/identify_the_problem/</link>

      <guid>https://frczero.org/engineering_design/design_process/identify_the_problem/</guid>
      <description>The first step in the design process is to identify the problem. This is the most important step in the process. If you don&amp;rsquo;t know what the problem is, you can&amp;rsquo;t solve it. The problem should be clearly defined. It should be specific, and not too broad. It should also be measurable. This means that you should be able to know when the problem is solved. For example, if the problem is &amp;ldquo;I want to build a robot that can score points in the game&amp;rdquo;, that is too broad.</description>

      <title>0.1 Why FRC0?</title>
      <link>https://frczero.org/about/why-frc0/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 04 Feb 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://frczero.org/about/why-frc0/</guid>
      <description>FRC0 was created to help address the following issues:
There is a lot of information about FIRST Robotics Competition, but it is spread out across many different websites and sources. There are not as many Mentors and Coaches as there are students. Guides like WPIlib, Rev, CTRE, and others are great, but they are not always easy to understand or they don&amp;rsquo;t cover all the topics. For example, the WPIlib guides do not cover the game or the competition.</description>

      <guid>https://frczero.org/pneumatics/what-are-pneumatics/</guid>
      <description>Originally discovered by the ancient Greeks, pneumatics is the study of air pressure. Pneumatics is a branch of fluid power that uses compressed air to power actuators. Pneumatic actuators are used to move mechanical parts, such as valves, cylinders, and other devices. Pneumatic systems are used in a wide variety of applications, including robotics, manufacturing, and construction.
In FRC teams typically use cylinders to extend and retract a piston. This can be used to move a mechanism in a linear direction, or to rotate a mechanism.</description>

      <description>The FIRST Robotics Competition is a competitive league for High School students internationally, to compete in yearly robotic challenges. The challenges usually involve building a full size robot to complete several tasks both autonomously and with a driver. The robot is built from scratch by the students and mentors of the team. The team is also responsible for fundraising, marketing and running the team like a business. They treat their sponsors as investors/stakeholders and are responsible for keeping them happy with long term growth planning, and short term goals.</description>

      <guid>https://frczero.org/engineering_design/design_process/research_the_problem/</guid>
      <description>Now that you know what the problem is, you can work towards solving it. Before reinventing the wheel and 3D printing it&amp;hellip; The best way to solve a problem is to find someone who has already solved it. This is called research. While this is not always possible, it is a good idea to try and find an existing solution. If you can&amp;rsquo;t find an existing solution, you can use the research to help you brainstorm a new solution.</description>

      <guid>https://frczero.org/engineering_design/design_process/brainstorming_ideas/</guid>
      <description>Brainstorming is the process of generating as many ideas as possible. This can and should be a fun process. The ideas do not all need to be good, they just need to be different. The more ideas you generate, the more likely you are to find a good idea among the nonsense. While brainstorming, it is important to not judge the ideas and really encourage free thinking. Ideas can be documented in many ways, but no matter what it should be fun and easy to do.</description>

      <guid>https://frczero.org/pneumatics/pneumatic-control/</guid>
      <description>Pneumatic control is the process of controlling the flow of air to the pneumatic system. This is done by using solenoids to control cylinders of various shapes and sizes. All of the cylinders are controlled using the same basic hardware. At a minimum, if you have followed along you should have a compressor, a pressure switch, a release valve, and a solenoid. The solenoid is the only part of the system that is controlled by the robot.</description>

      <description>What is iteration? Iteration is the process of repeating a given process over and over again. In the design process, iteration is the process of repeating the design process over and over again for each new problem that is encountered. The design process is cyclical, meaning that it is repeated over and over again. The design process is also iterative, meaning that it is repeated over and over again at any level of the process as needed.</description>
