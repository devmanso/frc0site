	"content": "What is a Brand? In the context of FRC the team\u0026rsquo;s brand can include its name, logo, and other visual elements. These elements are used to create a consistent look and feel for the team. By planning ahead, creating styling guides and more, the team can create a brand that is easily recognizable and memorable. It\u0026rsquo;s also easy to create new content that fits within the brand.\nNew members to your business and marketing team can make new content Day one and already have their templates and branding guidelines to follow. The rest of the sections will help you achieve this for your team.\nHow can we figure out what our brand is? Figuring out a core theme, ideology and more is a big task. Thankfully, if you already have a business \u0026amp; marketing plan you can use that to help. If you don\u0026rsquo;t have these or want to brainstorm new ideas then this can be done by asking the following questions:\nWhat is the team\u0026rsquo;s mission? What are the things that make the team unique? What are the team\u0026rsquo;s core values? If you could describe the team in one word, what would it be? If you are part of a school, does that school have a mascot? If so, how can you incorporate that into your branding? Poll your teammates and ask them what they think the team\u0026rsquo;s brand is. You may be surprised by the answers you get. Look at other teams and see what they are doing. What do you like? What do you not like? What can you do better? Is there a theme that you can use to tie everything together? For example, if your team is called the \u0026ldquo;RoboRams\u0026rdquo; you could use a ram as your mascot and incorporate that into your branding. Rams are known for being strong and agile, so you could use that to describe your team. Think about the colors and environment that a ram lives in and use that to help you create your branding colors. You could also use the ram\u0026rsquo;s horns to create a logo that represents your team. Lots of possibilities here. A good example of a \u0026ldquo;Ram themed\u0026rdquo; team is 59 RamTech link. What is a Branding Guide? Branding guides are a set of guidelines that are used to create new content and other visual elements. They are used to ensure that everything is consistent. Branding guides can include things like:\nLogo Logo Usage Sponsor Logos Color Palettes Verbiage (Slogans, etc.) Fonts (Print and Web) Product Images Social Media Images (Banner, Profile, etc.) Templates (PowerPoint, Word, etc.) Other Visual Elements (Icons, etc.) Can I an example of a branding guide? FIRST made a guide for their branding in 2015 that is a phenomenal resource for teams to use. You can find it below:\nViewer unavailable, click here to download the PDF!\nWhat is the difference between a brand and a logo? While a logo is part of an overall brand, the logo is just one small part of the brand. The brand is the overall look and feel of the team. It\u0026rsquo;s the colors, fonts, and other visual elements that are used to create a consistent look and feel for the team. While the logo will be used over and over again, the branding guides will be used to create new content and other visual elements and to ensure that everything is consistent.\nWhy do we need to specify how to use our logo? Their can be several version of your team\u0026rsquo;s logo. There can be a logo for print, a logo for web, a logo for social media, etc. There are also different file types, color variants and more. This can all get really messy and confusing. By making a Logo Usage Guide you can specify which logo to use, how to use it, and where to use it. This will help ensure that the logo is used correctly.\nThe logo is the most recognizable part of the team\u0026rsquo;s brand. It\u0026rsquo;s the part that people will remember the most. It\u0026rsquo;s also the part that will be used the most. If the logo is used incorrectly it can cause confusion and make the team look unprofessional.\nWhy do we need to specify how to use our sponsor logos? Sponsor logos are a big part of the team\u0026rsquo;s brand. They are used to show that the team has sponsors and to show that the team is supported by those sponsors. If the sponsor logos are used incorrectly sponsors will be upset and thats not good for anyone. Sponsors also could sometimes benefit from knowing what type of logo files the team needs for banners, shirts, and other items that feature the sponsors logos.\nWhy do we need to specify our color palette? Color palettes are used to create a consistent look and feel for the team. The colors that are used should be consistent across all of the team\u0026rsquo;s branding. This applies to powerpoint slides, word documents, social media posts, and more. Whenever the question comes up of \u0026ldquo;what color should I use?\u0026rdquo; the answer should be \u0026ldquo;use the colors from the branding guide\u0026rdquo;. You can even specify dark and light variants of the colors to use for different backgrounds and more.\nFor a color pallete tool you can visit canva\u0026rsquo;s color wheel tool.\nTo learn more about color theory you can visit W3 Schools Colors section.\nWhy do we include slogans and verbiage in our branding guide? Slogans and verbiage are critical because every word counts. The words that are used to describe the team should be consistent across all of the team\u0026rsquo;s branding. This applies to everything and whenever writing new content this can be referred to. Many teams will have slogans, mission statements, and more. These should be included in the branding guide.\nWhy do we need to specify our fonts? Fonts can vary greatly. Theres also variants of those font styles. For example, there is a difference between Arial and Arial Bold. There is also a difference between Arial and Arial Black. Sometimes a font should be \u0026ldquo;X size and Y color\u0026rdquo;, but other times it should be \u0026ldquo;X size and Y color and Z weight\u0026rdquo;. Writing all of this out can be a pain, but it\u0026rsquo;s worth it. By specifying the fonts that should be used, the size, color, weight, and more, it will help ensure that everything is consistent.\nTo learn about fonts you can visit W3 Schools Fonts section.\nTo learn about specifically web safe fonts you can visit W3 Schools Web Safe Fonts section.\nWhy do we need to specify our product images? While FRC teams don\u0026rsquo;t have products to sell (usually), they do have robots, designs, swag, and more than is photographed and shared. By specifying the product images that should be used you can make sure unedited photos aren\u0026rsquo;t used. This will help ensure that the team looks professional. This also is handy for making brochures, posters, and more. All of the good usable photos can be found in one place.\nWhat are social media images? Social media images are used by the teams various social media accounts. There are standard file sizes, dimensions, and more that should be used. Tools like Canva will help make these for you and have the sizing rules built in. Some of the various types of common social media images and their dimensions are:\nType Dimensions (px) Banner 1500 x 500 Profile 400 x 400 Post 1200 x 630 Story 1080 x 1920 Thumbnail 1280 x 720 Cover 820 x 312 Header 1500 x 500 Logo 400 x 400 Icon 512 x 512 Avatar 512 x 512 Favicon 32 x 32 Why do we need to specify our templates? Templates for letters, powerpoint slides, word documents, and more are a great way to ensure that everything is consistent. Whenever a new document is created it can include the logo, address, colors, fonts and more. Software like Word, Docs, and the generic office suites support custom theme templates. Even things like the header font, footer font, and more can be specified. This will speed up the time it takes to create new documents and will mean you can focus on the content instead of the formatting.\nA good resource about making themes for Google Slides can be found here.\nA resource for making document templates (Docs, Sheets, Slides, Forms, or Sites) can be found here.\n"

	"content": "What is the Engineering Design Process? The engineering design process is a series of steps that engineers use to solve complex problems. The process can be applied to any problem, not just engineering problems. The process is iterative, meaning that it is repeated over and over again until the problem is solved. The process is also cyclical, meaning that the steps are repeated in a loop. The steps are:\nIdentify the Problem Research Brainstorm Create a Prototype Test the Prototype Communicate the Results Repeat Continue reading to learn more about each step on the next page.\n"

	"uri": "https://frczero.org/engineering_design/design_process/identify_the_problem/",
	"title": "2.1.1 Identify the Problem",
	"tags": [],
	"description": "",
	"content": "The first step in the design process is to identify the problem. This is the most important step in the process. If you don\u0026rsquo;t know what the problem is, you can\u0026rsquo;t solve it. The problem should be clearly defined. It should be specific, and not too broad. It should also be measurable. This means that you should be able to know when the problem is solved. For example, if the problem is \u0026ldquo;I want to build a robot that can score points in the game\u0026rdquo;, that is too broad. You need to be more specific. A better problem would be \u0026ldquo;I want to pick up a ball from the ground and score it in the high goal\u0026rdquo;. This is a better problem because it is specific, and it is measurable. You can know when the problem is solved because you can score a ball in the high goal.\nFRC Specific Problems Every year we are given a new problem to solve. At first it can seem completely daunting and different from everything we\u0026rsquo;ve seen before. This however, is hardly true. Every year the game is a variation of the same problems.\n\u0026ldquo;How do we pickup and interact with objects, move across terrain and do some of that with the aid of sensors and feedback?\u0026rdquo;\nThis is the same problem we\u0026rsquo;ve been solving for years. The only difference is the specifics. The specifics are what make the game unique. The specifics are what make the game fun. The specifics are what make the game challenging. The specifics are what make the game exciting. The specifics are what make the game different. And while the specifics are what make the game unique, even those specifics are variations of the same problems we\u0026rsquo;ve been solving for years.\n\u0026ldquo;How do we pickup a cone or cube at ground level and raise it to a height of 36 inches?\u0026rdquo;\nThis is a specific problem question for the 2023 season. By just changing a few keywords we can use our first problem statement to put this new problem into perspective.\nTips for Identifying the Problem Read the Game Manual - The game manual is a great resource for identifying the problem. It includes robot construction rules, game rules and scoring. While FRC isn\u0026rsquo;t all about winning, the points are how teams are ranked. Therefore it\u0026rsquo;s best to try and solve the problems that will get you the most points. The game manual will tell you what those problems are. Talk to your Teammates - Your teammates are a great resource for identifying the problem. They can help you think of problems that you may not have thought of. They can also help you think of solutions to the problems you\u0026rsquo;ve identified. They can also help you think of ways to solve the problems that you\u0026rsquo;ve identified. Watch the Game Animation - The game animation is a great resource for identifying the problem. It shows you how the game will be played. It shows you how the game pieces will look like, how they are scored and what some of the strategies will be. Check Social Media - FRC specific social media like the discord, subreddit and chief delphi forums are great resources for connecting with other teams on the same problem. Everyone is working on the same problems and while it is a competition and it\u0026rsquo;s important to learn how to do things for yourself, asking others for help is always an option! Teams are always willing to help other teams and share their knowledge. Watch the Ri3D Broadcasts - The Ri3D broadcasts are a great resource for identifying the problem. They (Alumni) attempt to make a game specific robot in 72 hours (3 days). They live stream lots of the process, answer questions and share their knowledge. Next Steps Now that you\u0026rsquo;ve identified the problem, it\u0026rsquo;s time to research the problem!\n"

	"title": "7.1 Fusion 360",
	"tags": [],
	"description": "",
	"content": "What is Fusion 360? Fusion 360 is a 3D Design, CAM, and CAE tool from Autodesk. It is a cloud-based tool that allows you to design, simulate, and manufacture your robot. It is available for free to all FIRST Robotics Competition teams. Students and Mentors should sign up for a free account at https://www.autodesk.com/education/edu-software/overview?sorting=featured\u0026amp;filters=individual. After you setup or activate the Fusion 360 Educational access you should download it from https://www.autodesk.com/products/fusion-360/students-teachers-educators. You can also download the Fusion 360 app for your mobile device from the app store.\nWhat are some of the Pros and Cons of Fusion 360 vs. other CAD tools? Pros Cons Free for all FIRST Robotics Competition teams Cloud-based Available on Windows \u0026amp; Chromebooks Collaboration is easy File Viewer available for iOS and Android Cloud-based Teams Setup can be confusing How do I get started with Fusion 360? 1. Download Fusion 360 Download Fusion 360 from https://www.autodesk.com/products/fusion-360/students-teachers-educators. You can also download the Fusion 360 app for your mobile device from the app store.\n2. Install Fusion 360 Install Fusion 360 on your computer. You can also install the Fusion 360 app on your mobile device to view your designs on the go.\n3. Sign into your Fusion 360 account Sign into your Fusion 360 account. Double check that you are signed into the correct account. If you are not signed into the correct account, you can sign out and sign back in with the correct account. The fusion 360 Education account is different from the Personal account and has much more functionality. Your files and team connections will be different for each account as well.\n4. Create a new Fusion 360 Team or join an existing team If you are creating a new team, you will need to create a new team name. If you are joining an existing team, you will need to know the team name. The educator in charge of the \u0026ldquo;license seats\u0026rdquo; should also send a team invite email to make the process smoother, but it is not required.\nYou can always join a team later if you are not sure what team you are on. You can also create a new team later if you are not sure what team you are on or want to seperate your projects and work spaces with different organizations.\n5. Create a new Fusion 360 Project Create a new Fusion 360 Project. You can create a new project for each year or for each project. You can also create a new project later if you are not sure what project you are working on just yet. When making a new project, you can choose what to name it, where it is stored and more. If you dont know what to name it, you can always change it later, but you should know what you intend to make before you start trying to make it. \u0026ldquo;Robot Ideas\u0026rdquo; is a good name for a project that you are just starting to work on. \u0026ldquo;Robot 2023\u0026rdquo; is a good name for a project that you are working on for the 2023 season. \u0026ldquo;Robot 2023 - Chassis\u0026rdquo; is a good name for a project that you are working on for the 2023 season and is just for the chassis.\n6. Create a new Fusion 360 Design Create a new design by clicking on the + at the top of the screen. If you just opened Fusion 360 it opens with a new empty design called Untitled by default. You cannot import any outside parts or components into that design until you save it somewhere and give it a proper name.\nImporting parts and components into a design is covered in the next section. One other thing to note about your design before you make anything is to double check the Document Settings: units value to make sure its in whatever system you prefer (Metric or Standard).\n7. Import parts and components into your design If teams think ahead they can put all 3rd party vendor files into organized folders and then import them into their design. This will save a lot of time and effort later on. If you are just starting out, you can import parts and components into your design as you need them. You can also import parts and components into your design later if you are not sure what you need just yet.\nIf you are uploading a new part to Fusion 360, you can upload it from your computer by hitting the Upload button, then either browsing or dragging and dropping the files. Fusion is best at handling NON-MESH files like STEP. It can handle many types, but meshes like STL, OBJ, and FBX are not as good and will slow fusion to a crawl on even the beefiest of gaming computers.\nIf you are importing a part from a vendor, you should try to keep the original part names for the files. Vendors like McMaster-Carr and REV Robotics have a lot of similar parts and it is easier to find them if you know the part number.\nHow can I find a vendor part STEP file to even import? NOTE: every vendor has a different process for this. This is just a general overview of how to find a STEP file for a part. If you are having trouble finding a STEP file for a part, ask your mentor or a team member who has done it before. FRC discord and Chief Delphi are great places to ask for help also.\nVendor CAD Resources Link AndyMark (STEP Files) https://www.andymark.com/pages/resources-files?prefix=STEP%20Files/ AndyMark (2D Drawings) https://www.andymark.com/pages/resources-files?prefix=PDF%20Drawings/ VEX Robotics https://www.vexrobotics.com/pro/all/?q=empty\u0026amp;vex_site=cads VEX Robotics (Solidworks Partnership Search) https://www.3dcontentcentral.com/Search.aspx?arg=FRC\u0026amp;SortBy=match\u0026amp;PageSize=10\u0026amp;contentsourcefilter=Supplier%7CPlastic%20Supplier%7C-UserSupplied%20(SupplierAgent)%7CUser\u0026amp;suppliernavigator=VEX%20Robotics REV Robotics (CAD General) https://docs.revrobotics.com/docs/rev-ion#cad REV Robotics (Solidworks Partnership Page) https://www.3dcontentcentral.com/parts/supplier/REV-Robotics.aspx 9. Making a plate for the Power Breaker in Fusion 360 Step 1: Import the Power Breaker STEP file into your design. This one is tricky to find so im going to link download a copy I have hosted here. This one originally came from here.\nStep 2: Create a new sketch on the bottom face of the Power Breaker. This is the face that has the 4 holes for the screws. NOTE: Only 2 of the holes are used for the screws. The other 2 are for the Battery Positive line. You can ignore those holes.\nThis is what the sketch should look like. The sketch is a 2D representation of one face of the 3D model. You can see the 3D model in the background. The sketch is on the \u0026ldquo;bottom face\u0026rdquo; of the 3D model.\nStep 3: Select both screws by Ctrl + Clicking on them. Then clicking on the drop down at the bottom of the create tab, select the \u0026ldquo;Project\u0026rdquo; option near the bottom of the list. This will project the edges and lines that make up our bolt holes onto the sketch. This is a very useful tool for making holes in plates and other parts from existing 3D models.\nStep 4: Add a centered rectangle around the middle of the breaker. This is still part of the same sketch. For this short example you can just eyeball the center of the breaker. For more complex parts you can draw center lines or project more edges to get midpoints.\nStep 5: The size of the plate should leave plenty of room for easy safety access and leaving enough room for bolts with even a really thin material.\nStep 6: Finish the sketch by clicking the check mark at the top of the screen. This will take you back to the 3D design mode with your sketch visible. Now we can select the rectangle and extrude it out to make the plate. Note the extra pieces from the edges might get selected. You want the entire rectangle to be highlighted blue except for the holes. If you have extra pieces selected/unsleected, you can click on them with the Ctrl key held down to deselect/reselect them.\nStep 7: With the sketch of the plate selected still, click the \u0026ldquo;Extrude\u0026rdquo; button. This will bring up the extrude dialog. You can rotate the 3d model to get a better view of the Distance Arrow. As you drag it up and down, you can see the plate get thicker and thinner. You can also type in a value in the box. I used 0.25 inches since this is a fairly thick size that works for even the weakest of materials. You also need to check the Operation section carefully. There are 5 options all with different purposes.\nNew Body - This will create a new part in your design. This is useful if you want to make a new part from a sketch. You can also use this to make a new part from a 3D model. This is what we want to do here. New Component - This will create a new part in your design. This is useful if you want to make a new part from a sketch. You can also use this to make a new part from a 3D model. This is not what we want to do here. Cut - This will cut out the shape of the sketch from the part. This is useful if you want to make a hole in a part. This is not what we want to do here. Cut - This will cut out the shape of the sketch from the part. This is useful if you want to make a hole in a part. This is not what we want to do here. Join - This will add the shape of the sketch to the existing part part. This is not what we want to do here. Step 8: Click the \u0026ldquo;OK\u0026rdquo; button to finish the extrusion. This will create a new part in your design. You can see the new part in the tree on the left side of the screen. You can also see the new part in the 3D view. The part will be under Bodies and given a default name. You can rename it by double clicking on it in the tree or right clicking on it and selecting \u0026ldquo;Rename\u0026rdquo;. You can also convert it to a component by right clicking on it and selecting \u0026ldquo;Create Component from Bodies\u0026rdquo;. Finally if you did turn it into a component you could now export it, send a copy to a team mate or even convert the body inside of our component into a STL to be 3d printed.\n// TODO: Add a step for adding a hole for the battery positive lines.\n!!!YOU JUST MADE YOUR FIRST PART IN FUSION 360!!!\n"

	"content": "FRC0 was created to help address the following issues:\nThere is a lot of information about FIRST Robotics Competition, but it is spread out across many different websites and sources. There are not as many Mentors and Coaches as there are students. Guides like WPIlib, Rev, CTRE, and others are great, but they are not always easy to understand or they don\u0026rsquo;t cover all the topics. For example, the WPIlib guides do not cover the game or the competition. The CTRE guides are specific to the CTRE motor controllers and hardware. The Rev guides are specific to the Rev motor controllers and hardware. There is no comprehensive guide to FRC as a whole. Now there is. Rookie teams need an easy to follow guide to help them get started. Why do many of the pages look like powerpoint slides (On Desktop)? This website was built using the learn theme for Hugo. The learn theme is designed to look like powerpoint slides. This makes it easy to read and understand. The theme is also responsive, so it looks good on mobile devices. With this theme, we can focus on the content and not the design. Since the focus is on knowledge and information, the design is secondary. The biggest benefit of using Hugo and other SSG (static site generators) is new \u0026ldquo;posts\u0026rdquo; can be added to the site without having to rebuild the entire site. This makes it easy to add new content and keep the site up to date. If you are interested in learning about writing content for this site, please see the Writing Content page.\n"

	"description": "",
	"content": "Originally discovered by the ancient Greeks, pneumatics is the study of air pressure. Pneumatics is a branch of fluid power that uses compressed air to power actuators. Pneumatic actuators are used to move mechanical parts, such as valves, cylinders, and other devices. Pneumatic systems are used in a wide variety of applications, including robotics, manufacturing, and construction.\nIn FRC teams typically use cylinders to extend and retract a piston. This can be used to move a mechanism in a linear direction, or to rotate a mechanism. Cylinders are usually measured by the stroke length, bore diameter, and rod diameter. The stroke length is the distance the piston can travel in one direction. The bore diameter is the diameter of the cylinder. The rod diameter is the diameter of the piston. The bore and rod diameters are usually the same. They can also come in a large variety of sizes and styles.\nA typical pneumatic system in FRC can look something like this:\nImage courtesy of FRC 358\nBelow is a downloadable copy of FIRST\u0026rsquo;s pneumatics guide.

	"title": "6.1 Programming Languages",
	"tags": [],
	"description": "",
	"content": "What is programming? Programming is the process of designing, writing, testing, debugging, and maintaining the source code of computer programs. It is a set of instructions that tell a computer what to do and how to do it.\nProgramming languages are the languages used to write the source code of programs. There are many programming languages, each with its own syntax, structure, and rules. The four most popular programming languages used in FRC include Python, Java, C++, and LabVIEW.\nWhy do programming languages exist? Programming languages exist to provide a way for humans to communicate instructions to computers in a manner that they can understand and execute.\nComputers are essentially machines that perform operations based on a set of instructions. However, computers do not understand natural language like humans do, so programming languages provide a way for us to write code in a structured, formal syntax that the computer can interpret and execute.\nProgramming languages have evolved over time to become more user-friendly, easier to read, and capable of abstracting complex concepts into simple, high-level constructs. This makes it easier for humans to write and understand code, and allows for the creation of more complex programs.\nAdditionally, programming languages serve as a means of communication between developers, enabling them to share, reuse, and build upon each other\u0026rsquo;s code.\nIn summary, programming languages exist to provide a bridge between human language and the language of computers, enabling us to create software that can perform a wide range of tasks and solve complex problems.\nWhat is robotics programming? Robotics programming involves writing code that controls the behavior and actions of robots. This code can control how a robot moves, interacts with its environment, and processes information from sensors.\nThe basics of robotics programming usually start with understanding how to control the movement of a robot\u0026rsquo;s motors, how to gather and interpret data from sensors, and how to make decisions based on that data. This requires an understanding of the underlying hardware and how to communicate with it using code.\nOnce you have a basic understanding of these concepts, you can start writing code to control a robot\u0026rsquo;s movements, such as making it move forward, turn, and avoid obstacles. You can also write code that enables the robot to make decisions based on the data it gathers from its sensors, such as determining the distance to an object and avoiding collisions.\nOverall, robotics programming is an exciting and challenging field that combines both software and hardware skills. With time and practice, you can develop your skills and create more sophisticated robots that can perform complex tasks.\nThe next few chapters will guide you through the aspects of each programming language listed below this includes:\nSyntax: The set of rules and constructs that define how code is written in a particular programming language. This includes things like variable declaration, function definition, and control structures. Structure: The organization and arrangement of code, including the way in which code is indented, the use of white space, and the arrangement of functions, variables, and other constructs. Data Types: The different types of data that a programming language can handle, such as integers, floating-point numbers, strings, and arrays.

	"content": "The FIRST Robotics Competition is a competitive league for High School students internationally, to compete in yearly robotic challenges. The challenges usually involve building a full size robot to complete several tasks both autonomously and with a driver. The robot is built from scratch by the students and mentors of the team. The team is also responsible for fundraising, marketing and running the team like a business. They treat their sponsors as investors/stakeholders and are responsible for keeping them happy with long term growth planning, and short term goals. Winning the competition, or awards at events are short term goals.\nThis doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean to say winning some of the awards isn\u0026rsquo;t a multi-year effort. It is. But when compared to other goals, it is a short term goal. Most awards can be won in a single year, during just the Build/Competition Season. But now that we are on the subject of seasons, let\u0026rsquo;s talk about the FRC season schedule. The season extends far beyond the actual competition days and schedule. The season is broken down into four main parts: Pre Season, Build Season, Competition Season, and Post Season.\nPre Season Since many FRC teams have links or ties to a school system, preseason usually begins the first day back to school in the fall. Even though we don\u0026rsquo;t know the game for the upcoming season, there is plenty to keep teams busy during this time of year. The first thing to do is to get the team organized. This includes getting the team\u0026rsquo;s website up to date, restocking supplies and preparing for new members. The team should also be working on fundraising and sponsorships. This is a great time to get the team\u0026rsquo;s name out there and start building relationships with new potential sponsors.\nAnother big part of the pre season is training and team building. Every year in the fall, clubs and teams all start their recruitment drives. Teams should be at these new student open houses, pep rallies, and other events to get the word out about their team. This is also a great time to get new mentors and parent volunteers involved. New students like to hear about the team from other students, so it is important to have current students at these events and not just coaches or parents.\nGetting your team together is half the battle, getting them to accomplish complex tasks together is the other battle. This starts with making sure all members of the team, new and old, are trained/retrained on the team\u0026rsquo;s processes and procedures. This can include, but is not limited to, safety, tool usage, and team management. It is also important to make all members feel valued and welcome. No one wants to join a team of stuck up jerks who don\u0026rsquo;t treat them with respect. Be a gracious professional and let others in on the fun!\nBuild Season On the First Saturday of every year, the FIRST Robotics Competition Game and Rules are announced. This is the day known as Kickoff, when teams can start building their robots. Kickoff events are held at local colleges or large spaces, and teams will get their kickoff kit, watch the broadcast and tour the field. Teams can also do their own private kickoff events at their own meeting spaces and have their kickoff kit shipped for a fee. Both groups of teams will have the same amount of time to build their robots, and the same game to play. The only difference is when you get your kit in hand. The kit contains game elements and some starting pieces, but you can start without the kit if it arrives late.\nThe build season is the most challenging and stressful time of the year for teams. Teams have from the kickoff day until their first event to get everything built, coded, tested and ready to go. This is a very short amount of time, and teams will be working long hours to get everything done. In addition to the robot related tasks there are also additional awards, activities and tasks needed to be focused on at the same time. These include safety, strategy, outreach, and logistics. Small teams will really have to focus on their time management and prioritization skills to get everything done.\nFinally also during this time teams will select drivers, operators and drive coaches. These members should get lots of time with the robot and some accurate practice field pieces to try out different strategies. The world\u0026rsquo;s best designed robot is nothing more than a pile of parts if the drivers can\u0026rsquo;t use it. The drivers should also be trained on the rules and game elements, so they know what they can and can\u0026rsquo;t do. Scouting teams should be watching drive practices and taking notes on the drivers and their strategies. This will help them when they are scouting at events.\nIf a team did all of these things well and managed their time correctly they could attend some scrimmage events or arrange to practice with other teams in their area. Practicing alone is fine, but at the competition you are part of an alliance of 3. Learning how to talk with other teams and drivers in a stressful situation is a skill that can only be learned by doing. It is also a great way to get to know other teams and make new friends as well.\nCompetition Season The competition season is the time when teams travel to events and compete in the FRC competition with their robot. Events start on \u0026ldquo;Week 1\u0026rdquo; and normally run for 5-6 weeks before \u0026ldquo;District or Regional Championships\u0026rdquo; are held. Teams in the district systems will usually compete in 2 district level events and then based on the results compete at a week 6 or week 7 district championship. Teams in the regional system will compete in 1 regional event at least and based on their status move on. Teams that make it through either system will then compete at the \u0026ldquo;World Championship\u0026rdquo; in April. In some years there are two world championships, and other years there is only one. This depends on the number of teams that are competing.\nAt events teams will be go through a standard schedule of events. This is listed below:\nCheck In and Pit Setup Inspection Practice Matches Qualification Matches Alliance Selection Playoff Matches Awards Ceremony These events can be spread out over multiple days. A FIM (FIRST in Michigan District) event would typically have an evening setup day and then two full days of competition. Regional events and championships can run one extra day of competing. Each events schedule will be different, but the general flow of the day will be the same. Their unique schedules will be posted on the events page on FIRSTinspires.org. Event staff also will contact coaches with an itinerary of the event and need to knows.\nCheck In and Pit Setup Teams will arrive at the event and check in with the event staff. They will be given a pit space and a schedule of events. The team will then have to set up their pit space and get their robot ready for inspection. This is a great time to meet other teams and get to know the layout of the venue. Teams should also bring the following items to the event for check in and inspection:\nItem Description Required? Robot The robot can be worked on at the event, but it should be complete and ready to go before arrival Yes Driver Station The driver station is the computer that the driver uses to control the robot. It should be set up and ready to go before arrival Yes Team Roster The team roster is a list of all the members of the team. It should be updated and include all members of the team Yes Safety Manual The safety manual is a document that outlines the safety rules and procedures for the team. It should be in the pit space and available for inspection Yes FIRST Consent and Field Trip Forms These forms are required for all students and mentors to attend the event. They should be filled out and signed before arrival Yes Inspection After the team has set up their pit space, they will be inspected by the event staff. The inspection is to make sure that the robot is safe and ready to compete. The inspection checklist can be found here:\nViewer unavailable, click here to download the PDF!\nLRI (Lead Robot Inspectors) are amazing volunteers that do everything they can to make sure teams make it out onto the field. They are very knowledgeable and will often be called over when FTA\u0026rsquo;s (Field Technical Advisors) have questions. There priority is to get your bot inspected and out onto the field, they are NOT there to make your life miserable. If you have questions about the inspection process, ask them. They are there to help you.\nPractice Matches After the inspection is complete, teams will be allowed to practice on the field. This is a great time to test out your robot, calibrate vision and other sensors and get a feel for the field. Teams should also use this time to practice their strategy and get to know their potential alliance mates. Since the match pairings are randomized, teams will not know who they will be playing with until all teams are checked in. Get some practice in and show off your robot to the other teams. Scouters will be watching and taking notes, making mistakes during the practices is okay, during the real matches it\u0026rsquo;ll cost your team much much more.\nPractice matches will run on the real field, use the field radio system and be scored by the field. If you have never connected to the field before, this is a great time to get some practice in. The drive station laptops connect to the field with an Ethernet Cable. The field has a wireless network setup that all of the robots connect to. The robots data is then shared only to the team with the matching driver station. During the real matches field staff will want you to get setup and also teardown quickly. Practice matches are less rushed so you can take your time and get the process down.\nFinally, one thing to note and not get used to is the quiet. During practice matches, the stands will not be full and you will be able to hear the people on the other side of the field. During the real matches, the stands will be full and the noise will be loud. Your team will need to be good at communicating with each other loudly and clearly. Also think about the viewing angles you have of the field. Being behind the driver station glass will make it hard to see the other side of the field. Coaches are free to move around and get better views and relay information to the drivers. Practice this during practice matches so you are ready for the real matches.\nQualification Matches Starting on the second day of the event, teams will compete in qualification matches. These matches are the main part of the competition. Teams will be paired up with other teams and compete against them in 3v3 alliances. The alliances are created by a system called Matchmaker (there\u0026rsquo;s tons of documentation about this if you care). Teams will meet up with their partners ahead of match time and coordinate. Typically teams will have preferences for what tasks they can focus on, where their robot needs to start, and what their strategy is. Bring a field strategy sheet and whiteboard to the event to help you coordinate with your partners. Teams also laminate the following sheets and bring them to the event By laminating them, you can draw on them with dry erase markers:\nField Strategy Sheet Team Lineup Sheet Single Alliance Sheet Those sheets all came from the \u0026lsquo;2023 Strategy Board\u0026rsquo; topic here on Chief Delphi. They are a great resource for teams to use and share.\nMatch Scoring During the qualification matches, teams will be competing for the highest score possible. The breakdown of the scoring from REV Robotics and the 2023 game manual can be found below:\nAward AUTO TELEOP Ranking Point Mobility 3 - - Game Pieces - Bottom Row 3 2 - Game Pieces - Middle Row 4 3 - Game Pieces - Top Row 6 5 - Link - 3 Nodes in a row contain Game Pieces - 5 - Robot Docked and not Engaged 8 (1 robot max in AUTO) 6 - Robot Docked and Engaged 12 (1 robot max in AUTO) 10 - Park - 2 - Sustainability bonus - - 1 Activation Bonus - - 1 Tie - - 1 Win - - 2 What are Ranking Points and Why are they Important? Teams are ranked throughout the competition. The top 8 teams at the end of the qualification matches will be selected to be Alliance Captains for the Playoff Matches. Being a captain gets you extra points towards earning placement for the Championship events. While the scouting data teams have matters, the actual RP\u0026rsquo;s earned during the qualification matches are what is counted first by the actual ranking system. A full breakdown of the ranking system can be found below:\nOrder Sorting Tie Breaker 1st Ranking Points 2nd Average ALLIANCE MATCH points, not including FOULS 3rd Average ALLIANCE CHARGE STATION points 4th Average ALLIANCE AUTO points 5th Random sorting by the FMS Alliance Selection Remember all of that \u0026ldquo;Scouting\u0026rdquo; stuff your team did? All of the note taking, pain staking analysis and data collection? Well, it\u0026rsquo;s time to put it to use. After the qualification matches are complete, the Alliance Captains start to pick partners. Captains should be keeping track during selections of who is picked and who is not. This will help them make decisions on who to pick. The order they pick in is based on who best complements their team and partners. This may not be the same order as the ranking system. Teams who had great matches during the qualification matches will likely want to group back up again. If you are a captain you should have a list of all of the compatible teams from your scouting data.\nThey can pick each other, they can pick the bottom ranked team, or they can pick any other team. The Alliance Captains take turns picking until a total of 8 alliances of 3 teams are selected. The remaining teams are out of the playoffs, but they are eligible for many other awards still. The tournament is just part of the event, there are many other things teams can win. The top teams that weren\u0026rsquo;t picked are also asked to be ready to be an alternate for any of the other teams. If a team is unable to compete, the TOP ranked team next in line will be asked to join the alliance. If you are on an alliance in this manner you get all of the bonus RP that they would earn as well. This goes towards getting to the championship events.\nPlayoff Matches The playoff matches are the final matches of the event. The 8 alliances play against each other in a Double elimination bracket system. The picture below shows the bracket system.\nNow this year there will also be awards breaks during the final matches. This is in an attempt to actually speed up the overall event time. We will see how this pans out. Either way this is what everyone has been waiting for. The final matches. The matches that will determine who is the overall winning alliance. There are scenarios where there are ties and other things that can happen. The full rules for the playoff matches can be found here. Ultimately the matches are more or less the same as the qualification matches. The only difference is that the alliances are already selected and they wont change match to match, Teams will have limited time between matchs and will have to bring some of their pit tools to the field. Most of this information will be covered with the drive teams at the events.\nAwards The last part of the event is the awards ceremony. Normally this was done after the final matches had ended, as stated in the previous section, now the awards are done in between the final matches. Teams will see video submissions from award winners, hear descriptions and explanations of the awards, and then the awards will be given out. When a team is called for awards they usually all go down to the field, collect a medal, get high fives from the judges and gather at the back of the field for a team photo. Other teams are all cheering them on and congratulating them. Usually the judge explanations contain hints and puns and its fun to guess who is going to win. All of the awards are listed below and the full descriptions can be found here.\nMachine, Creativity, \u0026amp; Innovation Awards Autonomous Award sponsored by Ford Creativity Award sponsored by Rockwell Automation Excellence in Engineering Award Industrial Design Award sponsored by General Motors Innovation in Control Award Quality Award Team Attribute Awards Engineering Inspiration Award Gracious Professionalism® Award Imagery Award in honor of Jack Kamen Judges’ Award Rookie All-Star Award Rookie Inspiration Award Team Spirit Award Team Sustainability Award Submitted Awards FIRST Impact Award (formerly Chairman\u0026rsquo;s Award) Digital Animation Award sponsored by AutomationDirect.com FIRST Dean’s List Award Safety Animation Award sponsored by UL Solutions Woodie Flowers Finalist Award Robot Performance Awards Finalist - Celebrates the Alliance that makes it to the final match of the competition.

	"title": "3.1 What is Machining &amp; Fabrication?",
	"tags": [],
	"description": "",
	"content": "What is Machining? Machining is the process of cutting, shaping, and finishing materials using a machine. In FRC machining is used to create parts for the robot. This can be done using a CNC machine, a 3D printer, or a manual mill or lathe. There are many different types of these machines, and each has its own advantages and disadvantages. This section will cover the basics of machining and how to use some standard machines. This is not an exhaustive list of all the machines that can be used in FRC, but it should give you a good starting point.\nMachining is also a very old process. Don\u0026rsquo;t believe me? Check out this Machine shop at Greenfield Village in Michigan. This was a replica built in 1929 of the original 19th century Menlo park Machine Shop. The machines are driven by large generators, those then drive pulleys and belts that run all over the place to each machine. High tech stuff, but no 3d printers will be found here\u0026hellip;\nWhat is Milling? Milling is the process of machining using rotary cutters to remove material from a workpiece. Milling covers a wide variety of different operations and machines, on scales from small individual parts to large, heavy-duty machines. The other term for a milling machine is a mill or some people will use a brand name like \u0026ldquo;Bridgeport\u0026rdquo;. All three variations refer to same machine. There are also several configurations for milling machines.\nThe Vertical Mill, which is the most common type of milling machine. This machine has a spindle that is parallel to the ground. The spindle can be extended or the table can be raised and lowered, giving the same effect, allowing plunge cuts and drilling. The table can also swivel left and right, allowing for angular cuts. The table can also be tilted in either direction, allowing for helical cuts. The most common type of vertical mill is the Bed Mill. This machine has a stationary spindle and the table is moved both perpendicular and parallel to the spindle axis to execute cuts.\nIn simpler terms, a vertical mill has a cutting tool that moves up and down only. The piece being cut is attached to a table or bed that moves in two directions, perpendicular and parallel to the cutting tool. The machines bed can be adjusted to do angled cuts or other types if it is a more advanced machine. It can make cuts in all directions, it can drill holes and it can be adjusted with dials to make very precise cuts.\nPicture from FRC 254 of a student using a vertical mill. original image source\nWhat is Lathing? Lathing is the process of cutting a piece of material to a specific shape and size using a lathe. A lathe is a machine that rotates the workpiece around an axis of rotation to perform various operations such as cutting, sanding, knurling, drilling, or deformation, with tools that are applied to the workpiece to create an object with symmetry about that axis. Lathes can commonly be used in woodworking, but these are NOT metal lathes. Metal lathes are used to cut metal and are much more powerful and hence dangerous. Things you can do on a wood lathe are not done the same way on a metal lathe.\nA lathe has several moving parts. The workpiece is held in place by a chuck or faceplate. The chuck is a device that holds the workpiece in place while it is being cut. The chuck is mounted onto a spindle. The spindle does not adjust in place and needs to hold your piece perfectly centered. Before ever powering on the machine you can check the spindle to make sure it is centered by turning by hand and looking for wobble on the stock piece. If you have a tail stock, you can use that to center the piece and hold it on both ends. The spindle is powered by a motor and some lathes have adjustable transmissions for tougher materials.\nThen there is a tool post. Unlike a wood working lathe this is not meant for you to rest a hand cutter on. You must put the cutting tool in the holder and lock it in place. The cutting tool will experience a lot of force and will be pressed against the spinning stock. If the tool is not locked in place it will fly off and cause damage to the machine and possibly injury to the operator.\nThe movement in the x and y directions is done by two carriage systems and dials. Some machines also have motor driven carriages and can be programmed to do precise movements. The z axis is done by the tool holder. The tool holder is locked in place and the stock is moved in relation to the tool holder. This is done by moving the carriage systems and dials. The z axis is also done by the tool holder.\nFinally the operator can then turn on the spindle. Most lathes support bi-directional control with a Double Pole Double Throw switch. Pulling the lever out away from its base and up will start the machine one way. Pulling the lever out away from its base and all the way down will start the machine the other way. The lever can be set back to the middle and released to stop it. You can also press the E-Stop, but only if it is an emergency. The E-Stop will stop the machine immediately and will not allow it to be restarted until the E-Stop is reset and it can damage the machine. Use the proper controls to stop the machine!\nFRC 971 Lathe Training Manual Team 971 has a great training manual for lathe safety and operation. It is a great resource for learning how to use a lathe. You can view it below or download it. The viewer doesn\u0026rsquo;t work on mobile devices.\nViewer unavailable, click here to download the PDF!\nWhat is a CNC Machine? CNC or computer numerical control is a process that uses computers to control machine tools. CNC machines are used to make parts that would be difficult or impossible to make by hand. CNC machines are used in many different industries, including automotive, aerospace, and medical. CNC machines can make perfect circles, diagonals, and other shapes that are using two dials alone would be tough on a mill or lathe. If you want to do a thought exercise think about trying to write your name on an etch-a-sketch.\nThe dials on a mill can control one axis at a time. By turning both at once you can get a diagonal cut. This is not the same as a circle. A circle means you start one way, then have to reverse one dial, then the other, then the first one again, and then the second in a perfect, gradual pattern\u0026hellip; It is tough and it\u0026rsquo;s why we use computers to do that gradient for us. CNC machines can also be programmed to do repetitive tasks. CNC machines use Gcode to control machines. It can control the axis movement speed, it can jog to a specific point, it can adjust the spindle speed, perform tool changes and more.\nNotice how the term CNC can be applied to many different machines. Mills, Lathes, and even 3D printers can be CNC machines. CNC machines are not a specific type of machine, but a way of controlling a machine. This means if you understand the basics of CNC you can apply it to many different machines and tools. Gcode will change from machine to machine, but the basics of CNC operation will not!\nWhat is a 3D Printer? See, we pulled a sneaky on ya. 3D printers are not really \u0026ldquo;machining\u0026rdquo; in the traditional sense. Both milling and lathing are Subtractive manufacturing methods. They can only be used to remove material from a stock piece. 3D printing in its various forms is always an Additive manufacturing method. It can only be used to add material to a build plate. 3D printers are used to make parts that would be difficult or impossible for even Mills, lathes and molding to achieve. 3D printers can make parts that are very complex and have a lot of detail. 3D printing is much newer compared to milling and lathing and is still in its infancy.\n3D printers have several main parts that you should become familiar with. The easiest way to learn what they do is to explain how a printed part is made.\nA 3D model file is run through a slicing software. This software takes the 3D model and slices it into layers. Each layer is then converted into a series of Gcode commands. These commands are run by the printer and it will control the axis, tool end and other machine features. The printer will take in the file from the computer. This is done with an sd card, flash drive, direct connection or over wifi depending on your printer. The file will set the Build Plate and Extruder temperatures. The machine will start to heat up. Since 3D printing typically uses thermoplastics, the machine needs to heat up to the melting point of the plastic. The exact temperature depends on the plastic. PLA is typically 180-220C and ABS is typically 220-260C for your extruder. The build plate is typically 60-100C. Once the machine is heated up, the machine will move the Build Plate to the Home Position. The machine will then move the Extruder to the Home Position. Depending on your printer, the machine will then move the Build Plate to the start of the Gcodes first layer or it will move the Extruder to the start of the Gcodes first layer. The machine will then start to print the first layer. The Extruder will pull plastic from the spool and push it through the Extruder nozzle. The Extruder nozzle will then push the plastic onto the Build Plate. The Extruder will then move to the next point and repeat the process. This will continue until the layer is complete. Once the layer is complete, the machine will move up a set amount and repeat the process. This will continue until the part is complete. An FRC specific resource about 3D printing was created by team 7528 and can be found here. They have sample lessons for slicing, troubleshooting, and more.\nWhat is Fabrication? Now that we have a basic understanding of machining, let\u0026rsquo;s talk about fabrication. Fabrication is the process of building something from raw materials or your newly machined parts. This can involve welding, cutting, bending, and more. Fabrication is a very broad term and can be used to describe many different processes. For the purposes of this guide, we will be focusing on the processes that are most commonly used in FRC.\nWhat is Welding? Ahem\u0026hellip; Welding is the process of joining two pieces of metal together. There are many different types of welding, but the most common in FRC are MIG and TIG. MIG stands for Metal Inert Gas and TIG stands for Tungsten Inert Gas. Both of these processes use a wire electrode to create the weld. The wire is fed through a gun and the weld is created by melting the wire and the metal together. The difference between the two is the shielding gas. Both types of welding work on different materials. TIG welding is used on metals that are harder to weld. This includes aluminum, magnesium, and titanium. MIG welding is used on metals that are easier to weld. This includes steel, copper, and brass.\nThe arc is what melts the wire and the metal together and it is very very very bright, like YOU WILL GO BLIND bright. You should always have a welding helmet on and be behind a proper curtain if it is available. Just because you are protected with your helmet doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean the rest of your team is safe. Anyone who catches the arc even in a reflection can suffer blisters on their eyes and more. It is very important to be safe when welding.\nThe other kind of welding you could encounter outside of FRC is known as spot welding. This doesn\u0026rsquo;t pose a blinding risk, but is much more expensive. It also has very specific uses that aren\u0026rsquo;t really applicable to FRC. Spot welding is used to join two pieces of metal together by pressing two pieces together with an anvil and a punch. The punch is heated to a very high temperature and then pressed into the metal. This creates a weld that is very strong and can be used to join two pieces of metal together. This is used in the automotive industry to join car body panels together.\nWhat is Cutting? Cutting is the process of removing material from a piece of stock. While we already covered how to do this with machines like mills and lathes, this can also be done with hand tools like saws, angle grinders, and more. Cutting is a very broad term and can be used to describe many different processes. For the purposes of this guide, we will be focusing on the processes that are most commonly used in FRC.\nWhat is a Saw? A saw is a tool that is used to cut through materials. There are many different types of saws, but the most common in FRC are band saws and hacksaws. Band saws are used to cut through large pieces of metal. The blade is one continuous piece of metal that is wrapped around a wheel. The wheel is powered by a motor and the blade is pulled through the material. The blade is very sharp and can cut through material very quickly. Band saw blades will have different lengths, teeth counts and intended uses. A wood cutting blade will snap when and potentially injure someone if it is used on metal. A metal cutting blade will burn up wood pieces due to the higher friction and speed. It is important to use the correct blade for the material you are cutting.\nAnother common saw type is the table saw or chop saw. Chop saws can also be called mitre saws. These are very useful for cutting through materials at a specific angle. Both are also very dangerous and should only be used by people who have been trained on how to use them. These are used to cut through materials that are too large to fit on a band saw. These saws are very powerful and can be adjusted for blade depth, angle, and more. They are very dangerous and should only be used by people who have been trained on how to use them. All saws are dangerous, but these are especially dangerous for some reasons you might not expect. Pieces on a table saw can be flung off the blade and straight at people if it is let go of mid cut or ripped away from you. This can cause serious injury or death. It is very important to be safe when using a table saw.\nWhat is a Drill? A drill is a tool that is used to make holes in materials. There are many different types of drills, but the most common in FRC are hand drills and drill presses. Hand drills can also be known as power screwdrivers that also double as a cordless drill. Many brands exist out there, but they all are essentially the same. They have a rechargeable battery, a motor, and a chuck. The chuck is what holds the drill bit. The drill bit is what actually makes the hole. The motor spins the drill bit and the battery powers the motor. The drill bit is very sharp and can cut through material very quickly. The drill bit will have different lengths, diameters and intended uses. A wood cutting bit will snap when and potentially injure someone if it is used on metal. If you try to use a drill bit for milling by mistake it can bend or snap the bit, even if its a metal cutting bit. Mr. Siefen has seen this done far too many times\u0026hellip; It is important to use the correct bit for the material you are drilling.\nDrill presses work in much the same way, but they have a bed, possibly a vise and adjustable height. The drill bit is held in place by a chuck and that is attached to a spindle. The spindle can be plunged down into your stock material to drill a hole. The bed and vise can be brought up and down or turned to bring it in range of the drill bit and to line up the bit in the right spot on the material. Drill presses are very useful for drilling holes in materials that are too large to fit on a hand drill. These are also much more accurate. hand drills are controlled by your hands and not guaranteed to be straight or in the right spot. Drill presses are much more accurate and can be adjusted for depth, angle, and more. They are very dangerous and should only be used by people who have been trained on how to use them. If you have an adjustable speed drill press, or an oscillating drill press, you should be very careful when using changing the belts. Unplug the machine and ensure that the belt is not moving before you change it. If you are not sure how to change the belt, ask someone who does know how to do it.\nWhat is a Grinder? No, not the sandwich. A grinder is a tool that is used to grind down materials. There are many different types of grinders, but the most common in FRC are angle grinders and bench grinders. Angle grinders are handheld grinders that are used to grind down materials. They can be electrically driven, but are most commonly pneumatic. The grinding heads will come in a variety of shapes and sizes. The most common is a disc grinder. The disc is very rough and will grind down material very quickly. The disc spins at very high speeds and should be inspected before use. If the disc is cracked or damaged in any way, it should be replaced. Dremels are NOT grinders. They are rotary tools and should not be used to grind down materials. They are not designed to handle the forces that a grinder can put out. They will burn out and waste your time.\nSome other grinding types are flap wheels, wire wheels, and more. These all have very specific uses. Flap wheels are very useful for grinding down material, but not quickly. The flaps can be pushed inside of pieces or used to evenly remove material in round holes. Wire wheels are very useful for removing rust and paint from metal. They are very dangerous and should only be used by people who have been trained on how to use them and wearing the appropriate PPE like a ventilation mask.\nA bench grinder is a stationary grinder that is used to grind down materials. They are very similar to angle grinders, but will typically have removable wheels. One side is usually a grinding wheel and the other side is usually a wire wheel. These will have a very high RPM and MUST be attached down to a bench or table. They can be used to sharpen drill bits, deburr metal, and more.\nWhat is Bending? Bending is the process of bending a piece of material. This can be done with machines like a press brake or a hydraulic press. It can also be done with hand tools like a vise, a hammer, and more. Bending is a very broad term and can be used to describe many different processes. For the purposes of this guide, we will be focusing on the processes that are most commonly used in FRC.\nWhat is a Press Brake? A brake press is a machine that is used to bend metal. A piece of sheet metal is placed onto the bed. There is a die (the under side) and a punch (the top side). The die is what the piece of metal will be bent around. The punch is what will push the piece of metal into the die. There is also a back gauge that can be adjusted to control how far the piece of metal is pushed into the die. For most FRC uses a manual brake can bend 6061 aluminum. A manual brake is not as powerful as a hydraulic press, but it is much cheaper. Team 217, the Thunder Chickens use metal brakes for their designs. Speaking with them at MCC 2022 taught me so much and they were very helpful. Even back in 2007 they were using this technique to make custom chassis designs.\nWhat is a Hydraulic Press? A hydraulic press is a machine that is used to bend metal. Just like the manual press brake, a piece of sheet metal is placed onto the bed. There is a die (the under side) and a punch (the top side). The die is what the piece of metal will be bent around. The punch is what will push the piece of metal into the die. The hydraulics however make it much more powerful and much more dangerous. The hydraulic press can bend and punch much thicker materials than a manual press brake. Materials as thick as your arm. Many presses require two operators to enable the downward motion, or both hands of one operator on two buttons at once to ensure they are not accidentally pressed. The depth and pressure of the pressing is controlled from a control panel. A hydraulic press can be very dangerous and should only be used by people who have been trained on how to use them and wearing the appropriate PPE.\n"

	"content": "This section will show you some examples of team branding. We picked teams that we know, or we think are good examples of branding. If you know of a team that has good branding, please let us know and we will add them to this list.\nTeam 453 - Rockem Sockem Robotics (Author\u0026rsquo;s team) The Team Website was just redone with some of these ideas in mind. The previous website was a bit dated, and the new one is much more modern and easier to update using SSG just like frczero.org does. The team is also using Canva and Paint.net to do 99.9% of all graphical design work this year. In the past we\u0026rsquo;ve had a mixture of tools, designers and as you\u0026rsquo;ll see later on, some of the designs were not consistent. This year we are trying to be more consistent and use the same tools and processes to create all of our graphics.\nCurrent Branding Examples Previous Branded Items Even throughout the past (after we became RSR) we have always stuck to several core items. The Rockem Sockem Robots (This is kind of stealing from Hasbro?) but we\u0026rsquo;ve had this same branding usage for 10+ years. We are specifically \u0026ldquo;Robotics\u0026rdquo; and not Robots for this reason. We don\u0026rsquo;t use official artwork, but everything is heavily inspired. Our mascot costumes were officially licensed \u0026ldquo;Blue Bomber\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Red Rocker\u0026rdquo; halloween costumes. They are around, but will be getting a makeover soon due to age and wear.\nStudents on the team worked with our Graphic Arts teacher. He teaches at the school during the day and mentors the team, walk ins, former students and anyone willing to seriously learn. He helped us even back during our time as G.E.A.R.S. He gave the students alot of creative freedom and we didn\u0026rsquo;t have a \u0026ldquo;standard\u0026rdquo; like we do now. But this gave us a rich history of material to draw from now and in the future. ALWAYS KEEP PHOTOS OF YOUR WORK! Looking back at it now 10-20 years on is amazing!\nTeam 254 - The Cheesy Poofs (You knew it was coming, don\u0026rsquo;t lie) Their team website is here. The team has a very strong brand and is one of the most recognizable teams in FRC. They even have a published branding standards document that you can view here. They are a great benchmark and we based alot of this information on their branding standards document along with FIRST\u0026rsquo;s branding standards document and our own choices.\nTheir youtube channel is here.\nTeam 33 - The Killer Bees Their team website is here. They take branding to a different level when it comes to competition. If you ever see people with Yellow Antennae headbands, they\u0026rsquo;ve been visited by the bees. They have done a redesign of their branding recently and it looks great.\nTheir youtube channel is here.\nTeam 1868 - Space Cookies Their team website is here. They are an all girls team that is sponsored by NASA! They have a great professional website and are a great example of branding. They also publish a branding standards document that you can view here. They also have a branding summary here.\nTheir youtube channel is here.\nIf you want to add more examples, you can do so by editing this page on github and submitting a pull request or submitting an issue. We grabbed just a few to start with, but there are many more teams that have great branding. The files are large, so we didn\u0026rsquo;t want to include them all. If you want to add more, please do so and we will add them to the list.\n"

	"title": "2.1.2 Research the Problem",
	"tags": [],
	"description": "",
	"content": "Now that you know what the problem is, you can work towards solving it. Before reinventing the wheel and 3D printing it\u0026hellip; The best way to solve a problem is to find someone who has already solved it. This is called research. While this is not always possible, it is a good idea to try and find an existing solution. If you can\u0026rsquo;t find an existing solution, you can use the research to help you brainstorm a new solution. There are many different sources of information that you can use to research the problem. Some of the most common sources are:\nThe Internet - The internet is a great resource for finding information. Automation and engineering companies often have websites that include information about their products. You can also use search engines like Google to find information. It\u0026rsquo;s important to be careful when using the internet. Not all information on the internet is accurate. It\u0026rsquo;s best to use multiple sources to verify the information you find. Books - Books are a great resource for finding information. There are many books that are written specifically for engineering, electronics and programming. You can also use books to find information about specific topics. For example, if you are researching how to use a specific sensor, you can use a book about sensors to find the information you need. Videos - Videos are a great resource for finding information. There are many videos on Youtube and other video sharing websites that are made specifically for engineering, electronics and programming. FRC teams, vendors and others will make tutorials, guides and more. REV in 2023 worked on a \u0026ldquo;FRC Starer Bot\u0026rdquo; design with instructions. That video is available here. People - People are a great resource for finding information. There are many people that can give you ideas and inspiration. Your teammates, mentors, parents, teachers or even just friends. The more you talk about the problem, the more ideas you will have. AI - AI is a newer way of trying to research problems and it is controversial so I will discuss it briefly. You can ask conversational AIs like ChatGPT, GPT-3, or Cleverbot questions about the problem. The issue is YOU have to very thoroughly fact check the answers you get. The AIs are not perfect and they can be very misleading. They can also be very entertaining. I recommend using them if you are really stuck, if you know what you are doing, and if you have a lot of time to fact check the answers you get. FRC Specific Research Methods When the FRC game is announced, there are many resources that you can use to research the game. Some of the most common resources are:\nThe Game Manual - The game manual is a great resource for identifying the problem. It includes robot construction rules, game rules and scoring. While FRC isn\u0026rsquo;t all about winning, the points are how teams are ranked. Therefore it\u0026rsquo;s best to try and solve the problems that will get you the most points. The game manual will tell you what those problems are. The Game Animation - The game animation is a great resource for identifying the problem. It shows how the game will be played. It also shows how the game pieces will move. This can help you identify the problems that you will need to solve. The Game Q\u0026amp;A - The game Q\u0026amp;A is a great resource for identifying the problem. It includes answers to questions about the game. It also includes answers to questions about the game rules and scoring. This can help you identify the problems that you will need to solve. Some other sources teams have cited as useful are:\nThe US Patent and Trademark Office Google Scholar The unofficial FRC Mechanism Encyclopedia Look back at previous years\u0026rsquo; games and see what worked and what didn\u0026rsquo;t for similar problems Tips for Researching the Problem Read the Game Manual - Notice how we keep saying you need to read the manual? That\u0026rsquo;s because it\u0026rsquo;s important. Like really important. Like you should read it multiple times important. All of the research in the world is useless if you spend time on an illegal solution. Know what the rules are first! Talk to People - Talk to your teammates, mentors, parents, teachers or even just friends. The more you talk about the problem, the more ideas you will have. Even things like \u0026ldquo;My uncle does construction and they have a machine that places cones on the ground\u0026rdquo; can be useful. You never know what you will find out\u0026hellip; Watch \u0026lsquo;How It\u0026rsquo;s Made\u0026rsquo; - Shows that show how manufacturing and production works in the real world can often give you ideas. For example, if you are trying to figure out how to pick up a ball, you can watch a show about how a ball is made. You might see a way it is moved around the factory that you can use in your robot. Watch \u0026lsquo;Battlebots\u0026rsquo; - Okay, I can hear you now. \u0026ldquo;What does Battlebots have to do with FRC?\u0026rdquo; While FRC is NOT combat robotics, they are a similar size in some cases and are mobile robots with arms and other mechanisms. Just leave the flamethrowers at home. Get Creative with Digging - If you are having trouble finding information, think outside the box, try wild terms, and just keep looking around. Even looking at parts on vendor websites might help you think about how to solve the problem. For example, if you are trying to figure out how to pick up a ball, you can look at the compliant intake wheels on REV\u0026rsquo;s website. This could be a new way to pick up a ball that you haven\u0026rsquo;t thought of before. Don\u0026rsquo;t be Afraid to Ask Questions - If you are having trouble finding information, ask your mentors, parents, teachers or even just friends. They might have some ideas or know where to find the information you need. Now that you\u0026rsquo;ve researched the problem, it\u0026rsquo;s time to Brainstorm ideas!\n"

The design process is a series of steps that engineers follow to design a product. The number of steps varies depending on who you ask, but the main point is that its a cycle. The design process is a cycle because it is not a linear process. Engineers will go back and forth between the steps as they work on the design. The design process is also iterative. This means that the design will be improved over time.\nAn example diagram of the design process is shown above.\nBelow is an outline of the topics that will be covered in this chapter.\nContents for this Chapter Order Page Title Time Estimate 2.1 Design Process 30 minutes 2.2 Design Constraints 30 minutes 2.3 Design Sketches 30 minutes 2.4 Design Models 30 minutes 2.5 Design Testing 30 minutes 2.6 Design Review 30 minutes 2.7 Design Iteration 30 minutes 2.8 Design Documentation 30 minutes 2.9 Design Presentation 30 minutes Total 4.5 hours "

	"tags": [],
	"description": "",
	"content": "Now that you\u0026rsquo;re a little bit more aware of what FIRST Robotics Competition is, you may be interested in starting a team. This page will give you a brief overview of what it takes to start a team., what supplies you need, and how to get started. If you\u0026rsquo;re interested in starting a team, you should also check out the FIRST Robotics Competition Team Starter Guide.\nThis is a video produced by [FRC team 573] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZ9Z9Z9Z9Z9) that gives some more info.\nWhat Are Some Things to Consider When Starting a Team? There are many things to consider when starting a team. Some of the most important things to consider are:\nHow many students do you want to have on the team? How many mentors do you want to have on the team? How much time can members dedicate to the team? How much money can the team raise? How much space do you have to work in? Is the space you have to work in safe? Can you afford unexpected costs? Do you have a sustainable plan for the team? Do you have the backing of your school administration or another organization? Who Can Start a Team? Anyone can start a team! Students can start a team, teachers can start a team, parents can start a team, and mentors can start a team. The only requirement is that you have at least two adult mentors who are willing to help you start a team. You\u0026rsquo;ll also need some students, tools, space, funds for registration, and a lot of time. However, if you\u0026rsquo;re willing to put in the time and effort, it is absolutely worth it!\nWhat Are the Costs? The costs of starting a team vary from team to team. The costs can be broken down into two categories: registration fees and team expenses. Registration fees are the fees that FIRST charges to register a team. These fees are paid to FIRST and are used to cover the costs of running the FIRST Robotics Competition. Team expenses are the costs that the team incurs to build and maintain the robot, cover travel and other expenses. The two types of costs are separated for one main reason. The registration fees are a known item year after year. The other team expenses can vary wildly depending on your teams part inventory, new tool purchases and more. Below is a table that breaks down some of the costs associated with starting a team.\nCost Title Description Importance Rating (low = 1, high = 10) Cost ($) Registration Fees The fees that FIRST charges to register a team. These fees are paid to FIRST and are used to cover the costs of running the FIRST Robotics Competition. 10 6,000 (recently changed from 5,000) New Parts The parts that you need to build a new robot. 8 1,000 - 5,000 New Tools The tools that you need to build a new robot. 8 400 - 2,000 Hotels (not required always) The cost of hotels for the team. 5 1,000 - 3,000 Food, Gas, Busses, etc. The cost of food, gas, busses, etc. for the team (whole season). 5 1,000 - 3,000 Team Shirts, Banners, etc. The cost of team shirts, banners, etc. 5 200 - 800 Maintenance The cost of maintaining the robots basic parts year after year. 5 200 - 1,000 Miscellaneous The cost of miscellaneous items. Pit Display Props, Mascot Costume, Extra robots or practice field 5 varies wildly What Are Some Ways Teams Raise Money? There are many ways that teams raise money. Some of the most common ways are:\nFundraisers Donations Sponsors Grants What Are Some Ways to Find Sponsors? There are many ways to find sponsors. Some of the most common ways are:\nAsk local businesses Ask parents and friends of students, teachers, and mentors Ask other teams Reach out to your Local FIRST Robotics Competition District Speak to your local Chamber of Commerce or Government offices Reach out to your local media outlets What Are Some Ways to Find Mentors? There are many ways to find mentors. Some of the most common ways are:\nAsk local businesses Ask parents and friends of students, teachers, and mentors Ask other teams Reach out to your Local FIRST Robotics Competition District Speak to your local Chamber of Commerce or Government offices Reach out to your local media outlets Ask your school administration What Are Some Ways to Find Students? There are many ways to find students. Some of the most common ways are:\nDo show and tell at your school Ask other teams to demonstrate their robots Attend local events as a field trip and talk to students on teams Put up posters around your school for recruitment Have announcements made over the school intercom Create a sign up sheet for students to sign up for the team and get their contact information What Are Some Ways to Find a Space to Work? There are many ways to find a space to work. Some of the most common ways are:\nAsk your school administration Ask local businesses Ask other teams (Some teams are willing to let other teams use their space or even alternate between teams on a daily basis) Reach out to your Local FIRST Robotics Competition District Think about how you can use your school\u0026rsquo;s space (i.e. a classroom, a gym, a cafeteria, etc.) Think about how you can use your community\u0026rsquo;s space (i.e. a church, a community center, a library, etc.) You may need less space than you think. You can use a classroom, a gym, a cafeteria, a church, a community center, a library, etc. You can also use a combination of spaces. For example, you can use a classroom for meetings and a gym for testing the robot. You could use a common area for team meals and a 2nd classroom with computers for CAD and code. Theres lots of ways to work around space issues. However, you should think about what type of work you plan to do and the rules the space allows. You probably shouldn\u0026rsquo;t use a space that doesn\u0026rsquo;t allow you to use power tools or that doesn\u0026rsquo;t allow you to easily clean up after yourself.\nHow Can Parents Help? Parents do not have to be engineers or mechanics to help. Parents can learn those skills however by helping out on the team. Parents can help by:\nHelping with fundraising Helping with sponsorships Helping with team meals Helping with transportation Helping with field props Helping wrangle students Dealings with the school administration Picking up parts, tools, and supplies Towing the robot trailer Providing extra adult supervision Tons of other things How Can Teachers Help? Teachers or a member of the school administration can help by:\nHelping with fundraising and accessing school funds Helping with purchasing parts and tools with PO or school credit cards Allowing students to use the classrooms and school facilities Advising the team on school policies and procedures Helping write curriculum for the team Helping wrangle students Helping with grant writing and applications Letters of recommendation for students and alumni Tons of other things How Can Mentors Help? Mentors provide the technical expertise and leadership to the team. Mentors can help by:\nTeaching students how to build and program robots Teaching students how to use tools Teaching students how to use CAD software Teaching students how to use 3D printers Teaching students how to use CNC machines Teaching students how to use other manufacturing equipment Teaching students about engineering and science Teaching students about business and marketing Teaching students about leadership and teamwork Teaching students about life skills How Can Students Help? Students can help by:\nBuilding the robot Programming the robot Testing the robot Designing the robot Designing the robot\u0026rsquo;s logo Designing the robot\u0026rsquo;s website Designing the robot\u0026rsquo;s marketing materials Designing the robot\u0026rsquo;s pit display Coordinating match data and scouting Coordinating team meals Coordinating team transportation Coordinating team fundraising Coordinating team sponsorships Coordinating team outreach Coordinating team social media Setting up a long term plan for the team Setting up a short term plan for the team Setting up a budget for the team Setting up a schedule for the team Assigning or voting on a leadership structure for the team Tons of other things What Are the Suggested Tools for Starting a Team? There are many tools that can help you start a team. Some of the most common tools are:\nA computer (Drive station, CAD, etc.) A printer (CAD, marketing materials, etc.) Hand tools (Screwdrivers, wrenches, etc.) Power tools (Drills, saws, etc.) Wire strippers, crimper, and cutters Soldering iron and solder Multimeter Wago Tool (Specialty tool for wiring) Ferrule Crimper (Specialty tool for wiring) Molex Crimper (Specialty tool for wiring) Lathe, Bridgeport, or Mill (Specialty tool for manufacturing and not required) 3D Printer (Specialty tool for manufacturing and not required) CNC Machine (Specialty tool for manufacturing and not required) Other common carpentry tools (hammers, bolt extractors, pliers, etc).

The most common pneumatic components are shown in the table below:\nComponent Description Image Vendor Link(s) Solenoid A solenoid is a valve that uses an electric current to open and close. It is used to control the flow of air in a pneumatic system. Solenoids can be 12v or 24v. There is a jumper on the PCM for this and it sets the voltage level for ALL solenoids attached to it. The solenoids are marked for which voltage level they are meant to work with. Andymark Double Solenoid A double solenoid is a valve that uses an electric current to open and close. It is used to control the flow of air in a pneumatic system. It has two ports, one for air in and one for air out. Solenoids of both kinds are usually attached to manifold Andymark Compressor A compressor is a device that uses an electric motor to compress air. It is used to provide the air pressure for a pneumatic system. Teams can prefill tanks with an offboard compressor board. It must still use the PCM as its controlling hardware. Andymark Pneumatic Cylinder A pneumatic cylinder is a device that uses compressed air to extend and retract a piston. These can come in a wide variety of sizes and shapes. Andymark Pneumatic Tank A pneumatic tank is a device that stores compressed air. They don\u0026rsquo;t all have to be plastic. There is not a limit on the capacity of your tanks, however they must be rated for higher than 125 PSI Andymark Pneumatic Fitting A pneumatic fitting is a device that connects two pneumatic components together. Fittings can come in many different styles. There are splitters, T taps, and more! Andymark Pneumatic Hose A pneumatic hose is a device that carries compressed air from one component to another. These can come in a variety of colors and styles. All of the ones for FRC are 1/4 inch in diameter. Andymark Pressure Release Valve A pressure release valve is a device that releases air pressure from a pneumatic system. There are several types of these used in FRC. There are levers, spring pulls and more. As long as it can safely vent air in a hurry! Andymark Pressure Switch A pressure switch is a device that detects when the air pressure in a pneumatic system is above or below a certain value. Andymark Pressure Gauge A pressure gauge is a device that displays the air pressure in a pneumatic system. Andymark Analog Pressure Sensor An analog pressure sensor is a device that converts the air pressure in a pneumatic system into an analog voltage. Andymark Pressure Regulator A pressure regulator is a device that controls the air pressure in a pneumatic system.

The language has expanded significantly over time, and modern C++ now has object-oriented, generic, and functional features in addition to facilities for low-level memory manipulation.\nIn simple terms, C++ is a programming languages that is used for a wide variety of purposes. It is used to create operating systems, games, browsers, and so much more. It is a very powerful language that is used by many programmers. In FRC, C++ can be used to program the robot, and it is one that other teams will be likely to help debug at your events. It is different from Java, python and LabView and each has its own advantages and disadvantages. We try to use FRC or robotics concepts as much as possible in the following lessons, but we also try to keep the examples as general as possible so that you can apply them to other projects so I will use FRC algorithms and examples but not use actual libraries or structure for TimedRobot, CommandBased or other types.

	"title": "2.1.3 Brainstorming Ideas",
	"tags": [],
	"description": "",
	"content": "Brainstorming is the process of generating as many ideas as possible. This can and should be a fun process. The ideas do not all need to be good, they just need to be different. The more ideas you generate, the more likely you are to find a good idea among the nonsense. While brainstorming, it is important to not judge the ideas and really encourage free thinking. Ideas can be documented in many ways, but no matter what it should be fun and easy to do. Students should be encouraged to use whatever method they are most comfortable with.\nBrainstorming Techniques There are many different techniques that can be used to generate ideas. The following are some of the most common techniques.\nBrainwriting Brainwriting is a technique where each person writes down their ideas on a piece of paper. The papers are then collected and read aloud by the group. The group then votes on the best idea. The idea with the most votes is then used as the final design.\nBrainstorming with a Partner Brainstorming with a partner is a technique where two people work together to generate ideas. One person is the \u0026ldquo;idea generator\u0026rdquo; and the other person is the \u0026ldquo;idea recorder\u0026rdquo;. The idea generator is responsible for generating ideas. The idea recorder is responsible for writing down the ideas. The idea generator should not write down the ideas. This will help the idea generator to focus on generating ideas. The idea recorder should not generate ideas. This will help the idea recorder to focus on writing down the ideas. Then the partners switch roles and repeat the process.\nBrainstorming with a Group Brainstorming with a group is a technique where a group of people work together to generate ideas. One person is the \u0026ldquo;idea generator\u0026rdquo; and the rest of the group is the \u0026ldquo;idea recorder\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;feedback group\u0026rdquo;. The idea generator should present one idea at a time, get feedback from the feedback group, and then rotate roles. This repeats until the group has generated all of the ideas that they can think of.\nBrainstorming with Whiteboards or Post-Its Brainstorming with whiteboards or post-its is a technique where the group writes down their ideas on a whiteboard or post-it notes. The ideas are then collected and read aloud by the group. This can help people add ideas, visualize the ideas, and build on the ideas over a longer period of time. People can add notes, new ideas, and pictures to the ideas. Many people are visual thinkers and this tactile approach can help them to generate ideas too if they are not comfortable speaking in front of the group.\nBrainstorming with a Computer Using CAD, Simulation, photo editing tools and more can help you to generate ideas. You can use these tools to create 3D models, animations, and more. You can also use these tools to create images and videos to help you communicate your ideas. Creating your ideas digitally also helps to preserve your ideas. You can save your ideas and come back to them later. You can also share your ideas with others. Knowledge is the one thing that is free to share while not losing any value.\nBrainstorming Tips The following are some tips to help you brainstorm.\nDon\u0026rsquo;t judge ideas. Ideas are like children. They are all crazy, smelly and probably a little insane sometimes. But it\u0026rsquo;s rude to tell them that. So don\u0026rsquo;t judge your ideas. Just let them be. You never know when one of them will grow up to be a genius. Don\u0026rsquo;t be afraid to be wrong. You are going to be wrong a lot. That\u0026rsquo;s ok. It\u0026rsquo;s ok to be wrong. It\u0026rsquo;s ok to make mistakes. It\u0026rsquo;s ok to fail. It\u0026rsquo;s ok to not know. It\u0026rsquo;s ok to not understand. It\u0026rsquo;s ok to not be perfect. It\u0026rsquo;s ok to not be the best. It\u0026rsquo;s ok to not be the smartest. It\u0026rsquo;s ok to not be the most experienced. Its okay\u0026hellip; Everyone was a beginner. Everyone on your team has been wrong about something before, even your coaches and mentors probably. The important thing is to learn from your mistakes and keep trying. By presenting ideas you\u0026rsquo;ll learn what to improve and be better for the experience! Not everyone is going to like your ideas. That\u0026rsquo;s ok too. Teams are made up of many different people with different ideas. The way a team is successful is to compromise, debate or discuss the ideas and come to a consensus. There are tools out there to make it a formal and data driven process that we will cover in other chapters on the website. Take a break and think about something else for a while. Sometimes you need to step away from the problem and think about something else for a while. This will help you to come back to the problem with a fresh perspective. It will also help you to come back to the problem with a new set of ideas. This is called \u0026ldquo;divergent thinking\u0026rdquo;. While you can\u0026rsquo;t just run away from your problem, you can take a break. Your brain is not a computer, it is a muscle and when it\u0026rsquo;s had a workout it needs time to rest and recover. So take a break and come back to the problem later. Brainstorming Resources The following are some resources to help you brainstorm.\nBrainstorming Techniques Miro-lite Brainstorming Exercises More Brainstorming Techniques Now that you have generated some ideas, it\u0026rsquo;s time to evaluate them and choose the best one to prototype.\n"

	"content": "3.0 Machining \u0026amp; Fabrication There are many levels and types of machining and fabrication. The most common types of machining are turning and milling. Turning is the process of cutting a cylindrical shape into a piece of material. Milling is the process of cutting a flat shape into a piece of material. The most common types of fabrication are welding and 3D printing. Welding is the process of joining two pieces of metal together. 3D printing is the process of building a 3D object from a digital model. Teams without equipment like this can still benefit from the lessons in this chapter. Teams can learn how to make parts using other methods like hand tools and simple machines. Teams will also get advice on how to find new tools, access to mentors/shops, and how to use the tools they have. The lessons about machining and fabrication apply to all levels of teams. Teams can learn how to use the tools they have to make the best parts they can.\nBelow is an outline of the topics that will be covered in this chapter.\nContents for this Chapter Order Page Title Time Estimate 3.1 Machining \u0026amp; Fabrication 30 minutes 3.2 Machining \u0026amp; Fabrication Tools 30 minutes 3.3 Machining \u0026amp; Fabrication Safety 30 minutes 3.4 Machining \u0026amp; Fabrication Materials 30 minutes 3.5 Machining \u0026amp; Fabrication Design 30 minutes 3.6 Machining \u0026amp; Fabrication Tolerances 30 minutes 3.7 Machining \u0026amp; Fabrication CAD 30 minutes 3.8 Machining \u0026amp; Fabrication CAM 30 minutes 3.9 Machining \u0026amp; Fabrication CNC 30 minutes 3.10 Machining \u0026amp; Fabrication 3D Printing 30 minutes 3.11 Machining \u0026amp; Fabrication Laser Cutting 30 minutes 3.12 Machining \u0026amp; Fabrication Bridgeport Mill 30 minutes 3.13 Machining \u0026amp; Fabrication Lathe 30 minutes 3.14 Machining \u0026amp; Fabrication Welding 30 minutes 3.15 Machining \u0026amp; Fabrication Hand Tools 30 minutes 3.16 Machining \u0026amp; Fabrication Simple Machines 30 minutes 3.17 Machining \u0026amp; Fabrication Shop Access 30 minutes 3.18 Machining \u0026amp; Fabrication Shop Safety 30 minutes Total 9 hours "

	"content": "So you want to write content for the FRC0 website? Great! This page will help you get started.\nWhat is Markdown? Markdown is a lightweight markup language with plain text formatting syntax. It is designed so that it can be converted to HTML. It is often used to format readme files, for writing messages in online discussion forums, and to create rich text using a plain text editor. For more information, please see the Markdown Guide.\nWhat is Hugo? Hugo is a static site generator written in Go. It is optimized for speed, ease of use, and configurability. Hugo takes a directory with content and templates and renders them into a full HTML website. For more information, please see the Hugo Documentation.\nWhat does a page of markdown look like for FRC0? --- title: \u0026#34;1.1 Why FRC0?\u0026#34; date: 2023-02-04T22:22:45-05:00 --- FRC0 was created to help address the following issues: - There is a lot of information about FIRST Robotics Competition, but it is spread out across many different websites and sources. - There are not as many Mentors and Coaches as there are students. - Guides like WPIlib, Rev, CTRE, and others are great, but they are not always easy to understand or they don\u0026#39;t cover all the topics. - For example, the WPIlib guides do not cover the game or the competition. - The CTRE guides are specific to the CTRE motor controllers and hardware. - The Rev guides are specific to the Rev motor controllers and hardware. - There is no comprehensive guide to FRC as a whole. Now there is. - Rookie teams need an easy to follow guide to help them get started. ## Why do many of the pages look like powerpoint slides (On Desktop)? This website was built using the learn theme for Hugo. The learn theme is designed to look like powerpoint slides. This makes it easy to read and understand. The theme is also responsive, so it looks good on mobile devices. With this theme, we can focus on the content and not the design. Since the focus is on knowledge and information, the design is secondary. The biggest benefit of using Hugo and other SSG (static site generators) is new \u0026#34;posts\u0026#34; can be added to the site without having to rebuild the entire site. This makes it easy to add new content and keep the site up to date. If you are interested in learning about writing content for this site, please see the [Writing Content](/about/writing-content/) page. How do I write a page of markdown for FRC0? Its pretty simple. The first section is called the \u0026ldquo;Front Matter\u0026rdquo;. It is used to define the title and date of the page. The rest of the page is the content. The content is written in markdown. Try to keep the content to 1-2 paragraphs per section. This makes it easier to read and understand. I would also recommend using a plain text editor like Notepad++ or Visual Studio Code. These editors have plugins that make it easy to write markdown. Once you have new content ready to go, you can submit a pull request to our github with your new markdown content. We will review the content and add it to the site accordingly.\nHow do I add credit to a page? There is a method of marking the files beginning with something called front matter. Below is their method of marking it, however this won\u0026rsquo;t show up on the page in a visible way and it\u0026rsquo;s removed from the public HTML. I like being able to credit the individual authors who made the files so for now feel free to add a \u0026ldquo;By So and So - Created on 01-01-1984\u0026rdquo; under the title of the page. We will eventually have this auto generated based on the front matter data!\n---\rdate: \u0026#39;2012-04-06\u0026#39; (you can use full or shortened time stamps)\rtitle: \u0026#39;Page title\u0026#39;\rweight: 6.0 (the weight is used to sort it on the menu so if it\u0026#39;s in programming it\u0026#39;ll be 6.something)\rlastmod: \u0026#39;2012-04-06\u0026#39; (you can use full or shortened time stamps, this is only added if someone edits the original after it\u0026#39;s published)\rauthor: \u0026#39;your name\u0026#39;\reditors: \u0026#39;person1, person2, so on\u0026#39;\r--- If you\u0026rsquo;re adding a whole new chapter it\u0026rsquo;s gonna have different front matter. The only real difference is the chapter variable is set to true. The rest of the variables are the same. If you are an eagle eyed observer you\u0026rsquo;re also seeing that the example below uses = and +++ instead of : and \u0026mdash; like the first example. Either works, but they are exclusive to the page you are on. You CANNOT mix : with +++ or \u0026mdash; with =. Thats just how it is!\n+++\rtitle = \u0026#34;0.0 About FRC0\u0026#34;\rdate = 2023-02-04T22:22:45-05:00\rweight = 0.0\rchapter = true\rlastmod = 2023-02-04T22:22:45-05:00\rauthor = \u0026#39;Mr. Siefen\u0026#39;\reditors = \u0026#39;\u0026#39;\r+++ "

	"content": "Pneumatics are powerful and can be dangerous if not used properly. This section will cover the safety rules and guidelines for pneumatics. As is the case with all safety rules, they are not meant to be restrictive. They are meant to be guidelines to help keep you safe. If you have any questions about the safety rules, please ask your mentor or coach.\nSafety Rules Never use compressed air to propel a projectile. Never apply compressed air to the skin or direct it at a person. Even air at a pressure of 15 psig can cause serious injury. Never use a compressed air hose to clean dirt or dust from your clothing or body. Always wear safety glasses when working with pneumatics. Always check for humans and other objects in the path of the pistons, air, system, before turning on the compressor. Never turn on the compressor WITHOUT the pressure switch connected. Make sure that the release valve is open before turning on the compressor during initial setup. Wear ear protection. Exposure to excessive noise can damage hearing. Noise reducing mufflers can be fitted to machines to lessen the noise health hazard. Never use frayed, damaged or deteriorated hoses. Always store hoses properly and away from heat sources or direct sunlight. A hose failure can cause serious injury. Hose Reels can decrease your chances of injury, as well as help hoses last longer. Potential Hazards Tank Shattering Hearing Damage (Loud Compressor) Solenoid Failure (Misfiring mechanism) PCM Failure (Lack of control or Pressure Feedback) Air Leak (This can force hoses to slip off fittings) "

	"title": "2.1.4 Create a Prototype",
	"tags": [],
	"description": "",
	"content": "What is a Prototype? A prototype is a model of the final product. It is used to test the design and make sure that it works. A prototype is not the final product. While you could use a prototype as the final product, it is not recommended. On the first attempt at building a prototype, you should not use expensive materials. You should use cheap materials that are easy to work with. You should also use materials that are easy to replace. This will allow you to make changes to the prototype without having to worry about wasting expensive materials. You should also use materials that are easy to modify. This will allow you to make changes to the prototype without having to worry about wasting time.\nThings to Consider before Building a Prototype Before you build a prototype, you should consider the following:\nWhat materials will you use? How will you build the prototype? How will you test the prototype? How will you document the prototype? How long will it take to build the prototype? How much will it cost to build the prototype? What are the critical features of the prototype? What are the non-critical features of the prototype? What if we can\u0026rsquo;t decide between multiple ideas? If you have multiple ideas for the design, you could build a prototype for each idea, but this is not recommended. Instead, you should apply some techniques outlined below to help you decide which idea to pursue.\nPugh Matrix The Pugh Matrix is a technique that allows you to compare multiple ideas. It is a table that has the following columns:\nCriteria - This column lists the criteria that you will use to compare the ideas. Idea 1 - This column lists the value for each criteria for Idea 1. Idea 2 - This column lists the value for each criteria for Idea 2. Idea 3 - This column lists the value for each criteria for Idea 3. Total - This column lists the total value for each criteria. The criteria should be things that are important to the design. For example, if you are designing a robots drivetrain, the criteria could be:\nCost Safety Complexity Speed Effectiveness The values for each criteria should be numbers. The numbers should be relative to each other. For example, if you are comparing the cost of the drivetrain, you could use the following scale:\n1 = Very expensive 2 = Expensive 3 = Average 4 = Cheap 5 = Very cheap The total value for each criteria is the sum of the values for each idea. The idea with the highest total value is the idea that you should pursue. You can also apply weights to the criteria. For example, if you think that cost is more important than safety, you could give cost a weight of 2 and safety a weight of 1. This would mean that cost would be worth twice as much as safety.\nAffinity Diagram The affinity diagram organizes a large number of ideas into their natural relationships. It is the organized output from a brainstorming session. Use it to generate, organize, and consolidate information related to a product, process, complex issue, or problem. After generating ideas, group them according to their affinity, or similarity. This idea creation method taps a team’s creativity and intuition. It was created in the 1960s by Japanese anthropologist Jiro Kawakita. Source\nWhen should you use an affinity diagram?\nWhen you have a large number of ideas When you want to organize the ideas When you want to consolidate the ideas How do you use an affinity diagram?\nWrite down all of the ideas on sticky notes. Group the ideas into categories. Sort the categories into a hierarchy by some criteria. Write down the results and share them with the team. Now that we have an idea, how do we build a prototype? There are many ways to build a prototype. You could use a 3D printer, a laser cutter, a CNC machine, or you could use hand tools. You could also use a combination of these tools. The most important thing is that you use the tools that you are comfortable with. You should also use the tools that are available to you. In the early stages of prototyping even wood, cardboard and foam can be used to build a prototype. The important thing is to build a prototype that you can test.\n3D Printing 3D printing is a process that uses a 3D model to create a physical object. The 3D model is created using a 3D modeling program. The 3D model is then sent to a 3D printer. The 3D printer uses a nozzle to extrude a thin layer of plastic. The nozzle moves in the X and Y directions to create the layers. The nozzle moves in the Z direction to create the next layer. The 3D printer can create complex shaped pieces that would be difficult to create using other methods. These parts can vary in quality, strength and long term usability. They will speed up the prototyping process and allow you to test your design.\nLaser Cutting Laser cutting is a process that uses a laser to cut a material. The laser is focused into a small beam. The beam is then moved in the X and Y directions to cut the material. The laser can cut a wide variety of materials. These materials include wood, plastic, cardboard, foam, and fabric. The laser can cut very precise shapes. Designs are 2 dimensional and are created using specialized software.\nCNC Milling CNC milling is a process that uses a computer controlled machine to cut a material. CNC mills are usually controlled with G-code. G-code is a series of commands that tell the machine where to move and what to do. The machine is controlled using a computer. The computer sends the G-code to the machine. The machine then moves the cutting tool to the specified location and performs the specified action. CNC mills can cut a wide variety of materials and cutting tools can be changed for different materials or cutting actions. CNC mills can cut very precise shapes. Designs are 2D or 3D and are created using specialized software.\nHand Tools Hand tools are common, cheap and will work for 99.9% of the projects that you will work on. Hand tools include:\nSaws Drills Screwdrivers Hammers Pliers Files Wrenches Clamps Vises Measuring tools Taps and Dies Handheld power tools Most mechanics tool sets, carpentry tools and electrical tools will work for most projects. By following standard building practices, you can build a prototype that will work. Use the table saw to make a base plate, use hand saws to cut down axles and bar stock. Use taps to add threads to a new part, etc, etc, etc. The important thing is to build a prototype that you can test and iterate on.\nAfter creating the prototype, it\u0026rsquo;s time to test the prototype.\n"

	"description": "",
	"content": "What is a Falcon 500? The Falcon 500 is a motor and motor controller combination unit. It is a brushless motor with an integrated motor controller. The motor controller is a Talon FX motor controller. The motor is a brushless motor.\nLeaving aside any \u0026ldquo;Availability, Ethical (IFI Issues), Etc\u0026rdquo; The new Falcon v3s for the 2023 season have been noted to have a few issues. This page is a collection of fixes for those issues and to cover the basics of troubleshooting the Falcon 500 in the v1 and v2 variants as well.\nBefore you start, do you have your Falcon Fixing Kit? The Falcon Fixing Kit is a collection of tools and parts that you will need to fix the v1/v2 Falcon 500s. A B.O.M. for the v3 will be produced as soon as we get some\u0026hellip; The kit includes the following items:\nMedium Strength Loctite (Loctite 243) New screws for motor housings since the torx heads strip easily: Button Head Hex Drive Screw, Passivated 18-8 Stainless Steel, M3 x 0.50 mm Thread, 50mm Long McMaster-Carr Shaft shims 18-8 Stainless Steel Shims, for Shortening 5/16\u0026quot; Diameter Screw Shoulder, 0.02\u0026quot; Thick McMaster-Carr Hardened T10 Driver for case screws Bits, 1/4\u0026quot; Hex Shank for Power Tools, T10 Size McMaster-Carr Extended Hardened T8 bit for shaft screws Bits, 1/4\u0026quot; Hex Shank for Power Tools, T8 Size, 3-1/2\u0026quot; Long Overall Additional Notes from Chief Delphi User who came up with the B.O.M. above:\nI would also highly recommend you keep a bolt extractor set with left-handed drill bits and thread extractors. I had to use those on more than one occasion because the T10 case screws are soft and strip easily, or came out completely bent a few times after I fought them for an hour (hence the replacement screws above). We kept this set of tools and parts in the Falcon Un****** box and used it to QC verify (and fix) every one of the 32+ Falcon’s that passed through our shop last year.BOM Maker\u0026rsquo;s story from fixing them during the 2022 season\nContents for this Section Order Section Title 1. Wobbly Shaft 2. Broken Bolts 3. Missing Loctite 4. Overheating 5. Size Changes and Documentation Confusion 6. Falcon 500 V1 Teardown 7. Falcon 500 V2 Teardown 8. Falcon 500 V3 Teardown 9. Other Fixes Wobbly Shaft Teams who have bought Falcon v3 motors for the 2023 season have been reporting wobbly shafts. This is a result of the shaft tolerances being off and way out of the usual expected specs. It\u0026rsquo;s all a possible consequence of removing the shaft bolts(cuz they were loose cuz of missing loctite) It\u0026rsquo;s certainly not all motors, but teams ABSOLUTELY should check any v3 falcon 500s for this issue. Reddit Post identifying the issue\nFixes for the wobbly shaft 3d print a spacer to help keep the shaft on place. This can be the same falcon 500 spacers, but oversized by roughly 2mm. This came from the same reddit post, but has not been confirmed for a long term fix. Submit a RMA to VEX/CTRE/WCP for a replacement motor. This is a problem however as there are no parts for spares, vendors are out of stock for the remainder of the 2023 season https://www.vexrobotics.com/217-6515.html and if there are ones for RMA reserved, they will be subject to the same issue. This is a problem that will need to be addressed by the vendors. Don\u0026rsquo;t use a v3 Falcon 500 unless you dont have any other options. This is absolutely a really subpar option, but if you have no other options, you have no other options. Broken Bolts Teams who have bought Falcon 500s of all variants have been reporting broken bolts. This is a result of the bolts being too soft and stripping out or snapping. This is a problem that has been around for a while, but has been exacerbated by the new v3 falcons. These include longer screws that are too long in some cases and they were over tightened.\nFixes for the broken bolts Replace the bolts with stronger ones. This is a good option, but it is not ideal as Teams paying $220 for a motor should not have to replace the bolts. This is a problem that will need to be addressed by the vendors. If you break a bolt, you can use a bolt extractor to remove the broken bolt. This is a good option, but can lead to damaging the threads if not done correctly. A guide on how to do this can be found here Many teams will not be in a situation that they would need to be removing bolts except for the other issues listed here. If you are in this situation, and you need to remove bolts you should seriously consider the risks involved and the potential damage to the motor. Missing Loctite Teams who have bought Falcon 500s of all variants have been reporting missing loctite. This seems like not a big deal, except the bolts are crucial to the performance of the motor and its overall safety. This is a problem that has been around for a while, but has been fixed/exacerbated by the new v3 falcons. The rush to get the v3 falcons out the door while trying to avoid this has led partially to the wobbly shaft, and this is something seemingly to have been overlooked as a consqeuence of trying to fix it on the v1 and v2s in the past. Without the loctite, the bolts can come loose and cause the motor to fail during a match or practice.\nFixes for the missing loctite Replace the bolts with stronger ones. This is a good option, because more than likely you will strip/snap a bolt trying to QA inspect your bolts for loctite. This is a problem that will need to be addressed by the vendors. While I would normally recommend not taking apart a motor, this is a situation where you should take apart the motor and inspect the bolts. If you find a bolt without loctite, you should replace it with a stronger bolt as with all of the bolts and you should add loctite to the bolts. Use the 243 as listed in the BOM above. Overheating The Falcon 500 motors are High-Performance motors, and as such, they are designed to be able to handle a lot of power. However, they are not designed to be able to handle a lot of power for a long period of time. The motors are designed to be able to handle a lot of power for a short period of time, and then they need to be allowed to cool down. This is a problem that has been around for a while, but has possibly been improved by the v3. The jury is still out on this one. The motors feature air cooling ports that can be attached to your pneumatics system. A guide for this is here under the section called \u0026ldquo;Using the Falcon 500 Cooling Port\u0026rdquo;. Many teams who are not familiar with this, or don\u0026rsquo;t see the benefit of it, will not use it. This is a problem that will lead to burnt out and overheated motors.\nFixes for the overheating Use the cooling ports. This is a good option and is what the port is literally made for. Monitor the motors temperature. This is a good option, and it can help you know when you should let air in the ports to conserve air and the motor. This requires some extra work, but the Phoenix Motor controllers using the IMotorController interface have a method called getTemperature() that can be used to get the temperature of the motor. This reports the data in celsius\u0026hellip; but whatever. Java API Doc Don\u0026rsquo;t use the cooling ports. This is a bad option, but if you don\u0026rsquo;t have the time to monitor the temperature, or you don\u0026rsquo;t have working pnuematics on the bot you can just not use them. This is a problem that will lead to burnt out and overheated motors. This is done at the risk of the Team choosing to not use the port. Rather silly if you ask me. Size Changes and Documentation Confusion Something that caught many people off guard is the new larger size of the v3 vs the v1/v2 models. The v3 size is correct in the cad model, but the website for the Falcon 500 only has a v2 2D drawing. While most teams would instinctively use the updated 3D model, some teams may grab the 2D v2 in a rush and not notice the size difference until its time to assemble it all. This would mean redesigning things in a hurry or having to use the v2/v1s that are smaller. This is a problem that will need to be addressed by the vendors and they need to update the website to reflect the correct size of the v3.\nFixes for the size changes and documentation confusion Use the v3 3D model. This is a good option, and is the correct option. If you are not using a v3 then this is not an issue for you. Falcon 500 V1 Teardown We have a teardown of the Falcon 500 V1 motor. This is a\nFalcon 500 V2 Teardown We have a teardown of the Falcon 500 V2 motor. This is a\nFalcon 500 V3 Teardown The pictures and account you see here is in no way fictional. This is a real account of a real person who has a real Falcon 500 V3 motor. This was verified by Mr. Siefen who runs FRC0 and wrote the following guide. He took the pictures, stripped the screws, opened the stuff you shouldnt ever open. He did this so you dont have to. If you follow this guide WE (FRC0) and HE (ME, Mr. Siefen) are not responsible. This is purely for informational purposes, unintentional comedic relief during a stressful build season moment, and to show you what can happen and possible fixes.\nSteps and Comments Remove the case screws from the front of the motor. These are T9 torx screws. There are 3 per end of the motor. These are shorter than the ones on the V1/V2 and hopefully help with the bending/snapping of the previous ones. The front plate and shaft will come off after the removal of the previous screws. The shaft has a toothed end of the spline shaft that is inserted into a matching insert on the rotor. If you notice this is already massively different from the previous versions. You can separate the shaft spline from the front plate by pulling it out through the back. If you examine the shaft you\u0026rsquo;ll see how the large end is one piece that was done on a lathe and then it\u0026rsquo;s placed over the spline shaft It\u0026rsquo;s then joined with a pin and ground down to keep it locked in place. Before removing the back case screws look at the insides where the front screws were attached The posts look a little beat up, I was very gentle and the new shorter bolts only have a small amount of grab. You may want to get longer screws (idk if this is possible yet) if you are planning on face mounting the falcon V3 Also notice how much clearance you have from the air cooling ports to the rotor. If you plan to use either air cooling port you should not over extend your fittings. There\u0026rsquo;s about a fly\u0026rsquo;s eyelash worth of gap before you\u0026rsquo;ll be hitting the rotor and unintentionally braking the motor Flintstones style. These are the screws from both the front and back casing. They are the same so you don\u0026rsquo;t have to worry about mixing these up. However these are the only T9 sized torx screws on the falcon. If you didn\u0026rsquo;t already you can now remove the back casing screws. Do this gently since it\u0026rsquo;s the same soft grade metal as before and can strip out. Again this is still an improvement over the long case bolts that would snap/bend inside the casing. We lost 3 falcons this way our first year with them. When you take these off the case can slide off. Don\u0026rsquo;t worry right now about remembering how it goes back. There are 3 slots on the front and back plates to align it properly for assembly. Funny how the back side of the casing has loctite but the front posts had 0 sign of this… grrrrrrrr This is as far as you would ever need to disassemble the front half of a Falcon. Anything past this is beyond your control from this side. Idk why you would ever need to get the rotor apart and I have no clue how you would do that. Look at the back side on the motors cap. There are 2 bolt heads and sizes here. Both are for the talonFX technically. The two screws around the FX cap are protecting a data port. They don\u0026rsquo;t need to be removed unless you plan to use the port. I do this later on The three T10 security screws suckkkkkkkkk We stripped one of the three out. We were gentle and I don\u0026rsquo;t see why a team should be doing this so proceed ahead at your own peril… These are two of the three T10 security head screws for the talonFX. These screws keep the cap, hall encoder and motor controller PCB all aligned. Taking this apart can mess this up! There\u0026rsquo;s no sign of loctite here unless my colorblindness has messed me up again here. So why did I take it apart anyways? Science? No. You\u0026rsquo;ll see why soon. First off, this screw started to strip before I even starting trying to apply any pressure at all. As someone on reddit said \u0026ldquo;Really wish people would stop using security screw heads on products only engineers and mechanics will use\u0026rdquo; We know the security risks inherit and we need to be able to service these $220 motors when they were not properly QCd by the vendor Moving on to the data port screws while I calm down from the stripped screw… This is a 2.5 Allen! No torx needed for once, but now we\u0026rsquo;ve introduced a third tool and bolt size on this thing. So make sure to have all 3 sizes handy. These screws are so small. They will get lost if you even sneeze while doing this step. At comp they will be gone in an instant. Do not lose them as they are also not a size you can get at the local store. You will be forced to try and cut a longer bolt and file it down to this stub by hand and blood and tears Back to the stripped T10. It has now been transformed into a flathead as our screw remover was removed from the robotics lab by ghosts or a pack of raiders. If you are like us and don\u0026rsquo;t have a screw extractor, you can try to make a slot on the head with a Dremel. This is something we have practiced a lot No you can\u0026rsquo;t ask why we practice this. If you try to do this method be careful to not cut too deep and damage the motor. If you cut too far or wobble while cutting you\u0026rsquo;ll take off too much of the bolts head and the flat head will not work. So then I got the cap off. Remember how I said earlier I had a good reason for removing the cap? When I took this motor out of the box and shook it I heard a rattle. At first I expected this to be the wobbly shaft, but it was fine luckily. Then as I did the tear down I expected to find some loose metal, a spare bolt, something wrong in the front side. No dice obviously you saw what I saw. The spacer that goes on the T10 was not where it belongs and was loose in the cap. The other one was glued in place like it should be. This helps keep the cap from being over tightened and also keeps the Hall sensor that is the encoders for the Falcon, aligned and flat with the motor. Without this we would have not gotten accurate encoder data and with this being for a drivetrain that\u0026rsquo;s killer. Okay so that\u0026rsquo;s the end of disassembling a Falcon. Time to put it all back together. For the most part just reverse the steps in the guide. Remember how I said before there are 3 slots on the casing? One is solid and the other two look different. If you look at the back plate and the front plate there are matching grooves. When putting everything back together make sure to line these slots up properly. It\u0026rsquo;s the only way it actually goes back together anyways without any gaps. Other Fixes Did we miss something?\nIf you have any other issues that you have found with the Falcon 500, please let us know by adding it to the listings or submitting an issue on our github repo. We will be updating this post as we find more issues and fixes.\n"

	"title": "5.4 How to Setup a Pneumatic System",
	"tags": [],
	"description": "",
	"content": "Setting up a pneumatic system can be a daunting task. This section will cover the basics of setting up a pneumatic system. It will cover the basics of the components and how to connect them. It will also cover the basics of how to setup the compressor and the PCM and how to test the system.\nGatherings the Components The first step in setting up a pneumatic system is to gather the components. The components are listed below:\nCompressor Release Valve Pressure Switch Pressure Gauge x2 Manual Release Valve Air Tank Pressure Regulator Solenoid Pneumatic Hose Fittings \u0026amp; Connectors Pneumatic Control Module (PCM) or Pneumatic Control Hub (PCH) Compressor The air compressor is the heart of the pneumatic system. It is the device that compresses the air and stores it in the air tank. The compressor is connected to the PCM and the PCM controls the compressor. Compressors will automatically run unless the pressure switch is above the set pressure limit. The compressor can also be manually turned on and off from the robot code. The PCM and the compressor are connected with a 12V power cable. The red and black wire spots are marked on the PCM or Hub.\nThis is a close up of the wiring for the compressor and the PCM.\nRelease Valve The release valve is used to release the pressure from the system. The release valve is a non-electrical system that will manually go off if the pressure switch is overridden. All excess air pressure over 125psi will be released automatically when tuned properly. This is checked and tested by the inspectors.Don\u0026rsquo;t wait until competition to find out that your release valve is not working. Test it before you get to competition and while initially putting the system together.\nThis is a close up of the release valve.\nPressure Switch The pressure switch is used to control the compressor. The pressure switch is connected to the PCM next the compressor. The pressure switch is used to turn the compressor on and off. The pressure switches\u0026rsquo; air port is connected to the system on the high pressure side. By default the pressure switch is set to 120 psi. The pressure switch should NOT be adjusted. This is checked and tested by the inspectors. If the pressure switch is adjusted, the team will have to replace it with a stock one.\nThis is a close up of the tubing and port connection for the pressure switch.\nPressure Gauge (High Side) Pressure guages help us (humans) see the current PSI of the system using an analog (not electrical analog) dial indicator. The pressure gauge is connected to the system on the high pressure side. The best way to be able to use it is to put it somewhere that you can see it. Many teams will connect a T fitting to the high pressure side and then connect the pressure gauge and the pressure switch to the T-fitting(s). This allows the pressure gauge to be easily seen and the pressure switch to be easily connected. If it is also located near the manual release valve, it can be used to check the pressure before releasing the valve.\nThis is a close up of the tubing and port connection for the pressure gauge.\nManual Release Valve The manual release valve is used to release the pressure from the system. The manual release valve is a non-electrical system that will manually go off if a lever is pulled or a ball valve is turned. All air pressure from the system will be released when the valve is opened. This is checked and tested by the inspectors. This is a safety feature that is required on all FRC robots that store compressed air. It should be easily accessible and easy to use after a match has ended.\nThis is a close up of the manual release valve.\nAir Tank The air tank(s) are also located on the high side of the system. The tanks with either have a 1/4\u0026quot; NPT port or a threaded port to attach your own connectors. Whenever you are adding a new fitting, or removing an existing one, on a tank you need to:\nMake sure the tank is empty Wrap the threads with Teflon tape Tighten the fitting (Don\u0026rsquo;t over tighten) Check for leaks with a low pressure fill test before adding to your full system Add soap and water to an old spray bottle and spray the fittings to check for leaks. If you see bubbles, you have a leak. This is a close up of the tubing and port connection for the air tank.\nPressure Regulator The pressure regulator is what sets the PSI level for the low side of the system. Best practice is to set the pressure regulator to 60 psi. Solenoids can operate at more or less pressure by adjusting the regulator. Most regulators have a knob that can be turned to adjust the pressure. In order to adjust it you have to first pull up on the knob and then turn it. Clockwise increases the pressure and counter-clockwise decreases the pressure. The pressure regulator has an input side and an output side. Make sure which is which! The input side is sometimes marked with an triangle like in the picture below. The input side is the side that is connected to the high pressure side of the system. The output side is the side that is connected to the low pressure side of the system.\nThis is a close up of a pressure regulator.\nSolenoid In order to control the flow of air we use a special type of valve called a solenoid. Solenoids are controlled by the PCM or PCH. The solenoid has a port on the input side and a port on the output side. The PCM or PCH will send a signal to the solenoid to open or close the valve. The solenoid will open or close the valve depending on the signal it receives. The red and black wire spots are marked on the PCM or Hub. The block underneath the solenoid is called a manifold. The manifold is used to connect the air ports to the solenoid.\nThis is a close up of a solenoid and manifold.\nPneumatic Hose There are many vendors that sell the proper hose for pneumatic systems. The hose is measured by the inside diameter (ID) and the outside diameter (OD). The OD is the size of the hose and the ID is the size of the port that it connects to. The OD of the hose should be 1/4\u0026quot; and the ID of the port should be 1/4\u0026quot;. The hose should be flexible and not kink easily. The hose should be able to withstand the pressure of the system (125 psi MAX). Below is a table with the different types of hose and their pressure ratings with a column for the vendor with a link to the product page:\nVendor Hose Type Pressure Rating Link McMaster-Carr Polyurethane 150 PSI Link AndyMark Polyurethane 125 PSI Link AndyMark Polyurethane 116 Official/125 Tested PSI Link VEX Polyurethane Not Listed PSI Link Fittings \u0026amp; Connectors Fittings and connectors can vary wildly from vendor to vendor. The fittings and connectors should be able to withstand the pressure of the system (125 psi MAX). Below is a table with the different types of fittings and connectors and their pressure ratings with a column for the vendor with a link to the product page:\nVendor Fitting Type Pressure Rating Link McMaster-Carr Push to Connect 150 PSI Link AndyMark Various 125 PSI Link VEX Push to Connect Not Listed PSI Link Below is a chart with some images of the different types of fittings and connectors. Please note teams will have different names they use as casual names for the fittings and connectors. The names in the chart are the official names for the fittings and connectors:\nFitting/Connector Image Description Push to Connect Threaded 1/4\u0026quot; NPT port Push to Connect fittings are used to connect the hose to the ports. They are easy to use and can be used with a wide variety of hose. Push to Connect to 1/4\u0026quot; NPT Push to Connect to 1/4\u0026quot; NPT fittings are used to connect the hose to the ports. They are easy to use and can be used with a wide variety of hoses and fittings between the various styles of connectors. Push to Connect (T Connector) This type of connector splits off into 3 ends that can have Push to Connect ends Threaded 1/4\u0026quot; NPT (T Connector) This type of connector splits off into 3 ends that can accept 1/4\u0026quot; NPT fittings. 1/4\u0026quot; NPT 1/4\u0026quot; NPT fittings are used to connect the hose to the ports. They are easy to use and can be used with a wide variety of hose. 1/4\u0026quot; NPT to 1/4\u0026quot; NPT 1/4\u0026quot; NPT to 1/4\u0026quot; NPT fittings are used to connect the hose to the ports. They are easy to use and can be used with a wide variety of hose. 1/4\u0026quot; NPT to 1/4\u0026quot; NPT to 1/4\u0026quot; NPT (T Connector) 1/4\u0026quot; NPT to 1/4\u0026quot; NPT to 1/4\u0026quot; NPT fittings are used to connect the hose to the ports. They are easy to use and can be used with a wide variety of hose. There are also smaller types of fittings that are typically used for the solenoids. These are typically 1/8\u0026quot; NPT fittings. These are typically used for the solenoids and are not typically used for the main air lines. They can have a smaller diameter hose and are typically used only on the low pressure side of the system.\nUsing all of the combinations of fittings and connectors, you can create a wide variety of pneumatic systems. Your team will need to figure out what works best for your team\u0026rsquo;s unique hardware setup. Below are some example pneumatic fitting images in the context of FRC to help you get started:\nThis is an example of \u0026ldquo;The Fitting Type\u0026rdquo; connecting \u0026ldquo;__ \u0026amp; __ \u0026quot;\nThis is an example of \u0026ldquo;The Fitting Type\u0026rdquo; connecting \u0026ldquo;__ \u0026amp; __ \u0026quot;\nThis is an example of \u0026ldquo;The Fitting Type\u0026rdquo; connecting \u0026ldquo;__ \u0026amp; __ \u0026quot;\nThis is an example of \u0026ldquo;The Fitting Type\u0026rdquo; connecting \u0026ldquo;__ \u0026amp; __ \u0026quot;\nThis is an example of \u0026ldquo;The Fitting Type\u0026rdquo; connecting \u0026ldquo;__ \u0026amp; __ \u0026quot;\nConnecting the PCM or PCH to the RoboRIO and PDP Finally we can go through the process of connecting up the PCM or PCH to the RoboRIO and PDP. The PCM or PCH is connected to the RoboRIO and PDP using a 2 wire daisy chain commonly used in FRC called CAN. CAN or Controller Area Network is a serial bus that is used to connect multiple devices together. The RoboRIO and PDP are both CAN devices and the PCM or PCH is also a CAN device. You can support up to 63 CAN devices on a single CAN bus. most devices in the system will have 2 seperate Channels for in and out, except the Roborio which is a special case. The Roborio is always the starting point of your CAN connection in FRC.\nIn logical order the wiring for CAN should always go like this: RoboRIO -\u0026gt; (Other CAN devices) -\u0026gt; PCM or PCH -\u0026gt; (Other CAN devices) -\u0026gt; PDP (have the termimating resistor jumper active on the PDP)\nIn a system with no other CAN components, like CAN motor controllers or sensors, the PCM or PCH is connected to the RoboRIO and PDP using the following diagram:\nThis is a close up of the PCM or PCH to the RoboRIO and PDP. Note: The process is the same for both! This diagram was made in Fritzing. I dont have a PCH fritzings part so I used the PCM part. The PCH is the same as the PCM for CAN connection.\nThe power connections for the PCM or PCH are as follows:\nBattery Positive -\u0026gt; Breaker -\u0026gt; PDP Positive -\u0026gt; Roborio and PCM/PCH Positive through their dedicated and marked ports\nBattery Negative -\u0026gt; PDP Negative -\u0026gt; Roborio and PCM/PCH Negative through their dedicated and marked ports\n"

	"title": "2.1.5 Testing a Prototype",
	"tags": [],
	"description": "",
	"content": "Testing the prototype that you created is an important step in the design process. It allows you to make sure that the prototype works as expected. It also allows you to make changes to the prototype early in the design process. This will save you time and money in the long run. Time in the FRC season is very limited, so you should make sure that you are spending your time wisely. The testing process will also help you be ready for inspection at the competition. You should test your prototype as often as possible. You should also test your prototype in as many different situations as possible. This will help you find any problems with the prototype before you have to use it in a competition.\nWhat to Test Test Description Functionality This test checks to make sure that the prototype works as expected. Safety This test checks to make sure that the prototype is safe to use. Appearance This test checks to make sure that the prototype looks good. Durability This test checks to make sure that the prototype is durable. Cost This test checks to make sure that the prototype is cost effective. Weight This test checks to make sure that the prototype is not too heavy. Size This test checks to make sure that the prototype is not too big. Quality This test checks to make sure that the prototype is of high quality and accurate. How to Test Functionality The functionality test checks to make sure that the prototype works as expected. Functionality is a wishy-washy term, so you should be more specific. For example, if you are testing a drivetrain, you should test the following:\nDoes the drivetrain move forward? Does the drivetrain move backward? Does the drivetrain turn left? Does the drivetrain turn right? Does the drivetrain work at extreme speeds? What is the maximum controllable speed? Safety The safety test checks to make sure that the prototype is safe to use. Safety is crucial and should be a top priority. You should test the following:\nIs the prototype safe to use? Are there any sharp edges? Are there any pinch points? Are there moving parts that should be covered? Are there any parts that could break off and cause injury? Are there any parts that could break off and cause damage to the robot? Are there any parts that could break off and cause damage to the field? Are there any parts that could break off and cause damage to other robots? Are there any parts that could break off and cause damage to the audience? Appearance The appearance test checks to make sure that the prototype looks good. Appearance is important, but it is not as important as functionality and safety. You should test the following:\nDoes the prototype look good? Does the prototype look professional? If it is a branded part, does it look correct and professional? If it has sponsor logos, do they look correct and professional? If its painted or powder coated, does it need retouching? If it is a 3D printed part, is it smooth and free of layer lines? Durability The durability test checks to make sure that the prototype is durable. Durability means the ability to withstand wear and tear. You should test the following:\nHow long does the prototype last? (Assuming you have multiple prototypes) What is the maximum amount of force that the prototype can withstand? What is the maximum amount of stress that the prototype can withstand? What is the maximum amount of weight that the prototype can support? What are the weakest points of the prototype? What are the strongest points of the prototype? How does the prototype hold up in extreme conditions? Cost The cost test checks to make sure that the prototype is cost effective. Cost effectiveness means that the prototype is cheap to make and cheap to use. You should test the following:\nHow much does it cost to make the prototype? If parts need to be purchased, how much do they cost? How often will parts need to be replaced? How much do those parts cost? How can we use prototype parts in the final robot? How can we use prototype parts in future robots? Weight The weight test checks to make sure that the prototype is not too heavy. Weight is important because it affects the robot\u0026rsquo;s performance and there is a legal weight limit. You should test the following:\nHow much does the prototype parts weigh individually? How much does the prototype weigh as a whole? How much does the prototype weigh compared to other versions of the prototype? How can weight be reduced? How can weight be redistributed? How can weight be added? Size The size test checks to make sure that the prototype is not too big. Size is important because it affects the robot\u0026rsquo;s performance and there is a legal size limit. You should test the following:\nHow big are the prototype parts individually? How big is the prototype as a whole? Do the parts fit in the robot? Do the parts fit together? How can size be reduced? How can parts be combined to reduce size? What is size of bolt holes and other mounting points compared to other parts? Quality The quality test checks to make sure that the prototype is of high quality and accurate. Quality is important because it affects the robot\u0026rsquo;s performance. You should test the following:\nHow accurate is the prototype? How accurate is the prototype compared to other versions of the prototype? How accurate is the prototype compared to the CAD model? How accurate is the prototype compared to the design specifications? Can the prototype be improved? How can the assembly process be improved? How can the design process be improved? How can the manufacturing process be improved? What is the quality of the prototype compared to other parts of the robot? Testing Tips Test the prototype as often as possible. Test the prototype in as many different situations as possible. Test the prototype in extreme conditions. Test the prototype in extreme situations. Test the prototype in extreme environments. Test the prototype in extreme temperatures. Document the results of the tests. Documenting the Tests and Results There are so many easy ways to document the tests and results. You can use a notebook, a spreadsheet, a word document, or a wiki. You can also use a combination of these methods. You should document the following:\nWhat was tested? What was the result? What was the expected result? When was the test performed? Who performed the test? What was the test environment? Can the test be repeated? What was the test procedure? What tools and equipment were used? After you have documented the tests and results, you should analyze the data and communicate the results with the team.\n"

	"content": "Pneumatic control is the process of controlling the flow of air to the pneumatic system. This is done by using solenoids to control cylinders of various shapes and sizes. All of the cylinders are controlled using the same basic hardware. At a minimum, if you have followed along you should have a compressor, a pressure switch, a release valve, and a solenoid. The solenoid is the only part of the system that is controlled by the robot. The compressor and solenoids are controlled by the PCM/PCH. The pressure switch stops the compressor if it detects anything above 125 psi. In case that fails there should ALWAYS be a mechanical safety valve that is properly tuned.\nWithout diving into the code portion yet, let\u0026rsquo;s look at the hardware. The solenoid is the only part of the system that is controlled by the robot so far. The compressor will just automatically run nonstop until a certain max PSI limit is reached. This assumes there is code for enabling the compressor somewhere in your code. A guide for this including with the changes for 2023 is here for Java and C++.\nControlling the Different Solenoids via Code There are two different types of solenoids that are used in FRC. The first is the single solenoid. This is the most basic solenoid and is used to control airflow in a single direction. The second is the double solenoid. This is used to control two different directions of airflow. Both have some basic commands for controlling them. This is an example from wpilib for the single solenoid. An example for the double solenoid is here.\nOperating the Solenoids Manually (Without Full Code) NOTE: You still need to have the rest of your system enabled and controlled with the PCM/PCH properly. This is just a way to manually control the solenoids without having to write code for it. This is useful for testing and debugging.\nMany of the FRC solenoids feature a button on their top. When this is pressed it forces the solenoid to change the direction of the air flow. This should be done with EXTREME CAUTION as you will be right next to the solenoid, and given the laws of space and time, probably near the cylinder you\u0026rsquo;re gonna set off.\nThe button on the top of the solenoid is used to manually change the direction of the air flow.\nControlling the Air Compressor in Code with Better Feedback By using an analog pressure sensor, teams can get much more detailed information about the pressure in the system. This allows for more accurate control of the system. This is especially important for teams that are using a compressor that is not controlled by the PCM/PCH. This is a guide for using the analog pressure sensor in Java and C++.\n"

	"content": "Why is it important to communicate the results? Communicating the results of the design process is important because it allows you to share your ideas with others. It also allows you to get feedback on your ideas. This feedback can help you improve your design. Communicating the results of the design process is also important because it means you have your data organized in a way that is easy to understand. If the design has been that thoroughly analyzed, it is likely that many of the basic design flaws will be caught before the final product is built before getting feedback from others.\nHow do you communicate the results? There are many ways to communicate the results of the design process. The most common way is to write a report. The report should include the following:\nIntroduction - This section should include a brief description of the problem that you are trying to solve. It should also include a brief description of the solution that you are proposing. This section should also include a brief description of the design process that you used to solve the problem. Background Research - This section should include a brief description of the research that you did to learn more about the problem that you are trying to solve. It should also include a brief description of the research that you did to learn more about the solution that you are proposing. This section should also include a brief description of the research that you did to learn more about the design process that you used to solve the problem. Design Process - This section should include a brief description of the design process that you used to solve the problem. It should also include a brief description of the design process that you used to learn more about the solution that you are proposing. This section should also include a brief description of the design process that you used to learn more about the design process that you used to solve the problem. Results - This section should include a brief description of the results that you got from the design process. It should also include a brief description of the results that you got from the design process. This section should also include a brief description of the results that you got from the design process. Conclusion - This section should include a brief description of the conclusions that you made from the design process. It should also include a brief description of the conclusions that you made from the design process. This section should also include a brief description of the conclusions that you made from the design process. Example Report Here is an example of a report that you could write to communicate the results of the design process:\nIntroduction\nThe problem that I am trying to solve is to make a robot that can pick up a ball and put it in a cup. The solution that I am proposing is to use a robot arm to pick up the ball and put it in the cup. I used the design process to solve this problem.\nBackground Research\nI did some research to learn more about the problem that I am trying to solve. I learned that there are many different types of robots. I also learned that there are many different types of robot arms. In my research I found that arms come in many DOF (degrees of freedom). The more joints, the more DOF and the more complex the arm is to build and control.\nTo keep the design simple, I am proposing a 2 DOF arm. I chose a 2 DOF arm because it is simple to build and control. I also chose a 2 DOF arm because we have many of the parts needed in our inventory.\nDesign Process\nIn order to figure out what torque and speed I need for the motors, I used the design process to solve this problem. By using a planetary gear system, I was able to change the speed and torque of the motors with new ring sets as needed. The overall size of the gearbox stays the same, so it is easy to change the gear ratio without having to redesign the mounts.\nResults\nThe results that I got from the design process are that the arm can pick up a ball and put it in a cup. The arm can also pick up a ball and put it in a cup. The arm can also pick up a ball and put it in a cup.\nHowever, the speed was too slow and we can reduce the amount of torque needed by using a better gear ratio.\nConclusion\nThe conclusions that I made from the design process are that the arm can pick up a ball and put it in a cup. The arm should be as simple as possible and the challenge could be solved with as few as 2 DOF. The arm\u0026rsquo;s torque and speed can be adjusted by changing the gear ratio. This makes it simple to change the arm\u0026rsquo;s torque and speed without having to redesign the mounts or the design at all.\nWhat are some other ways to communicate the results? Below is a list of other ways that you can communicate the results of the design process:\nMethod Description Pros Cons Presentation A presentation is a way to communicate the results of the design process. - It is easy to share your ideas with others. - It is easy to get distracted. Video A video is a way to communicate the results of the design process. - It is easy to share your ideas with others. - It is easy to skip crucial parts. Now that you have learned about the design process, you can apply it to fix the new problems found with the prototype. This is called iteration or repeating the design process.\n"

	"content": "6.0 Programming In FRC there are 4 main programming languages that are used. These are Java, C++, LabVIEW, and Python. Each language has its own advantages and disadvantages. The language that you choose to use will depend on your team\u0026rsquo;s preferences and the programming language that your mentors are most comfortable with. The programming language that you choose to use will also depend on the programming language that your team\u0026rsquo;s robot controller is programmed in. The robot controller is the computer that controls the robot. The robot controller is a NI RoboRio. The Roborio can be configured for any of the languages listed above.\nRobot code is also not the only type of programming done in FRC. Teams write GUI software for their drive stations, they make games in Unity and Unreal Engine, and they write code for their websites. Students also learn how to write low level firmware for devices like arduinos and raspberry pis. Programming is a very important part of FRC and students can come into FRC with little to no programming experience and leave with a very strong understanding of programming. The guides here are intended to help in that process and also expose students to the different types of programming that are done in FRC.\nBelow is an outline of the topics that will be covered in this chapter.\nContents for this Chapter Order Page Title Time Estimate 6.1 Programming Languages 30 minutes 6.2 Java 30 minutes 6.3 C++ 30 minutes 6.4 LabVIEW 30 minutes 6.5 Python 30 minutes 6.6 Robot Code 30 minutes 6.7 Timed Robot 30 minutes 6.8 Command Based Programming 30 minutes 6.9 RobotBuilder 30 minutes 6.10 Path Planning 30 minutes 6.11 Robot Simulation 30 minutes 6.12 Vision Processing 30 minutes 6.13 ROS 30 minutes 6.14 GUI Programming 30 minutes 6.15 Unity 30 minutes 6.16 Unreal Engine 30 minutes 6.17 Web Development 30 minutes 6.18 Arduino 30 minutes 6.19 Raspberry Pi 30 minutes "

Free How can a team design a website like frczero.org using Hugo? While the Learn Hugo Theme tutorial is a great resource for learning how to use Hugo, it is not a great layout for a Team or Branding website. For a teams website to be successful, it needs to be designed to be easy to use and easy to navigate. The learn theme may not be the best choice. The table below lists some of the most common themes for Hugo:\nTheme Name (link) Description Learn The learn theme is a theme designed for knowledge websites. Ananke The ananke theme is a theme designed for blog websites. Hugo Coder The hugo coder theme is a simple and clean blog theme. Theme.gohugo.io The theme.gohugo.io website lists many themes for Hugo. I used that to find these themes! How to Install Hugo on Windows (Properly!!!) Note: The following instructions are based on the Hugo Installation Guide\nDownload the latest version of Hugo from the Download the Windows ARM 64bit version or see the Hugo Releases page for other versions.\nExtract the zip file to a folder on your computer. (I recommend somewhere with a short path like C:\\hugo). The zip file should contain a single executable file named hugo.exe and a folder named LICENSE.md and README.md. If you try to run the hugo.exe file now, it will open a command prompt window and then close. This is because the hugo.exe program is not a gui program. It is a command line program. To run the hugo.exe program, you need to open a command prompt window and then run the hugo.exe program from the command prompt window. DO NOT DO THAT YET! Wait for step 7.\nOpen the command prompt window. To do this, press the Windows key and the R key at the same time. This will open the Run dialog box. In the Run dialog box, type cmd and then press the Enter key. This will open the command prompt window. (You should do this as an administrator. To do this, right click on the command prompt icon and then click on the \u0026ldquo;Run as administrator\u0026rdquo; option.)\nIn order to actually use the hugo command and not have to use C:/hugo/hugo.exe you need to add it to your PATH! To do this in the command prompt window type set PATH=%PATH%;C:\\hugo\\bin and then press the Enter key. (You should replace C:\\hugo\\bin with the path to the folder where you extracted the hugo.exe program.)\nChange the directory to the folder where you extracted the hugo.exe program. To do this, type cd C:\\hugo and then press the Enter key. (You should replace C:\\hugo with the path to the folder where you extracted the hugo.exe program.)\nTo test that the hugo command is working, type hugo version and then press the Enter key. This should print the version of Hugo that you installed. If it does not print the version of Hugo that you installed, then you should go back and make sure that you followed the instructions correctly.\nIf you are confident that you followed the instructions correctly, then you should try to reinstall Hugo. If you are still having problems, then you should submit an issue on the frczero.org github repo How can a team use a theme and Hugo? Using any theme with Hugo will come with its own set of instructions. There are things that they all have in common though. The following instructions are based on the Hugo Quick Start Guide. This also assumes you have already installed Hugo on your computer.\nCreate a new Hugo website using the following command:\nhugo new site my-website Change the directory to the new website:\ncd my-website Add the theme to the website:\ngit init \u0026amp;\u0026amp; git submodule add \u0026lt;link to theme repo you want to use\u0026gt; themes/\u0026lt;name of theme\u0026gt; Copy the example site from the theme to the website:\ncp -r themes/\u0026lt;name of theme\u0026gt;/exampleSite/* . Edit the config.toml file to change the theme to the theme you want to use:\ntheme = \u0026#34;\u0026lt;name of theme\u0026gt;\u0026#34; Start the Hugo server:\nhugo server Open a web browser and go to localhost:1313 to see the website.\nHow can a team use the Ananke theme and Hugo? Note: The following instructions are based on the Hugo Quick Start Guide. This also assumes you have already installed Hugo on your computer.\nNote 2: The following instructions are based on the Ananke Theme Quick Start Guide. To see the theme in action, visit the Ananke Theme Demo.\n//TODO: These instructions are incomplete and students had issues following them at a recent workshop. They need to be updated. 1. Create a new Hugo website using the following command: ```bash hugo new site my-website ``` 2. Change the directory to the new website: ```bash cd my-website ``` 3. Add the Ananke theme to the website: ```bash git submodule add https://github.com/theNewDynamic/gohugo-theme-ananke themes/ananke ``` 4. Copy the example site configuration to the website: ```bash cp themes/ananke/exampleSite/config.toml . ``` 5. Edit the website configuration file called config.toml and change the theme to ananke: ```toml theme = \u0026#34;ananke\u0026#34; ``` 6. Create a new post using the following command: ```bash hugo new posts/my-first-post.md ``` 7. Edit the post file called my-first-post.md and add the following content: ```markdown --- title: \u0026#34;My First Post\u0026#34; date: The Date Goes Here as a Timestamp draft: false author: \u0026#34;Your Name\u0026#34; editors: \u0026#34;Your Team Members\u0026#34; --- This is my first post! ``` 8.

	"content": " Sometimes things dont work as expected. This section will help you troubleshoot your pneumatic system.\nCommon Issues with Pneumatics Pneumatic solenoids are not working Check the solenoid wiring. Is the solenoid wired to the PCM? Is the solenoid wired to the correct channel? Is the solenoid wired with the correct polarity? Check the solenoid. Is the solenoid plugged in? Is the solenoid broken? If using a manifold, check the manifold for a proper seal If its a double solenoid, check they are both not firing at the same time Check the PCM. Is the PCM powered? The PCM is connected to the PDP and there is a small 20A fuse on the PDP for it and the VRM to share. Check the status of this fuse. Is the PCM wired to the correctly via CAN? Does it have the proper CAN ID? The PDP and PCM should ALWAYS ALWAYS ALWAYS have the same CAN ID of 0! All of the FRC libraries assume this ID setup! Is the PCM firmware up to date? A guide to updating the PCM firmware can be found here as well as a general primer to CTRE CAN devices. For more specifics about troubleshooting for the PCM check here Is the system enabled? Check the code to make sure the system is enabled. Check the dashboard to make sure the system is enabled. Is the Robot Status Light flashing or solid? If flashing, the robot is enabled If solid, the robot is disabled but powered on. If off, the robot is not powered on. Is the system full with enough air to move the cylinder? Check the pressure gauge to make sure the system is full. Check the pressure regulator to make sure the low side level is set to around 60 psi for most teams. Pneumatic solenoids are not firing at the same time Check the Previoisly mentioned items for the solenoids. Check the code to make sure the solenoids are firing at the same time. If using a double solenoid, only use one k.direction command at a time. Check where the solenoids are being fired from. If they are being fired from different commands they will never truly be firing at the same time. The command scheduler will only run one command at a time for a subsytem. If you want to fire both solenoids at the same time, you will need to fire them from the same command. If using a timed robot, check that whatever functions are firing the solenoids are not being called seperately. If they are, they will not be firing at the same time. Are both solenoids using the same types of fitting and length of tubing? If not, the solenoids will not be firing at the same time. The solenoids will be firing at different times depending on the length of tubing and the fittings used. a. The amount of air needed to move the cylinder is dependent on the length of tubing and the fittings used. There are specifically fittings with screw caps that let you fine tune the pressure for each solenoid or cylinder. If yes, check for any physical leaks on the solenoids or the tubing connections. a. Get an old bottle with a spray nozzle and spray a SMALL amount soapy water on the connections. If bubbles appear, there is a leak. The System is Never \u0026ldquo;Full\u0026rdquo; and the Compressor Runs Forever Check the pressure gauges on both sides of the system (high and low pressure) If the low pressure gauge is reading 0 psi, the pressure regulator may be setup incorrectly. Check the direction of the pressure regulator. The high side is the inlet and the low side is the outlet. Check the low side pressure. It should be around 60 psi for most teams. If the high pressure gauge is reading 0 psi, the system is not full and has no air stored. Check that all manual valves are closed. Check all pneumatic fittings for leaks. Check the connections to the compressor for the release valve and the pressure switch. Check the pressure switch. If it is broken, the compressor may NEVER turn off. The System is Full but the Compressor Runs Intermittenly at Rest NOTE: Some air loss is unavoidable. The compressor will run to keep the system full. If the system is full and the compressor is running anyways, this is NOT normal. Check the pressure gauges on both sides of the system (high and low pressure) Check for leaks at all connection points. Check the connections to the compressor for the release valve and the pressure switch. If the release valve is not tuned properly it may be letting air out of the system too early. If the pressure switch has a loose connection or is broken, the compressor may operate intermittently. The PCM has a Sticky Fault Check the PCM for a sticky fault. Check the phoenix tuner self test. There is a clear sticky fault button on the self test menu! I have no idea if this can happen to the PCH but phoenix is only for CTRE products so I am assuming not. Check the status light on the PCM. Whats a sticky fault? A sticky fault is a fault that is not cleared by the code. This means that the code is not telling the PCM to clear the fault. This can happen if the code is not running or if the code is not telling the PCM to clear the fault. This can also happen if the PCM is not wired to the CAN bus properly. What makes it sticky? A sticky fault is a fault that is not cleared easily with a reboot. The PCM is Connected, I Can See it\u0026rsquo;s Proper Firmware version, but the Compressor Doesn\u0026rsquo;t Run Check the status light on the PCM. If the status light is flashing, the PCM is enabled. If the status light is solid, the PCM is disabled. If the status light is off, the PCM is not powered. Check the code to make sure the compressor is enabled. With the introduction of the new PCM firmware, the compressor enable command is NOT the traditional setClosedLoopControl(true) command. The new command is setDigitalEnable(true) for Java. Another new deprecated command is enabled(). This function checked the status of the compressor. Now it is called isEnabled() for clarity. Check the WPIlib documentation for more information here The PCM is Connected, I Can See it\u0026rsquo;s Proper Firmware version, but the Solenoids Don\u0026rsquo;t Fire Check the status light on the PCM. If the status light is flashing, the PCM is enabled. If the status light is solid, the PCM is disabled. If the status light is off, the PCM is not powered. Check the code to make sure the solenoids are set to the proper port number and PneumaticsModuleType. With the introduction of the new PCM firmware, the commands for setting up the solenoid objects are not the same as the old PCM firmware either. The new commands are Solenoid exampleSolenoidPCM = new Solenoid(PneumaticsModuleType.CTREPCM, 1); for a PCM, or Solenoid exampleSolenoidPH = new Solenoid(PneumaticsModuleType.REVPH, 1); for a PCH. With the introduction of the new PCM firmware, the commands for setting up the double solenoids are not the same as the old PCM firmware either. The new commands are DoubleSolenoid exampleDoublePCM = new DoubleSolenoid(PneumaticsModuleType.CTREPCM, 1, 2); for a PCM, or DoubleSolenoid exampleDoublePH = new DoubleSolenoid(9, PneumaticsModuleType.REVPH, 4, 5); for a PCH.

	"content": "What is iteration? Iteration is the process of repeating a given process over and over again. In the design process, iteration is the process of repeating the design process over and over again for each new problem that is encountered. The design process is cyclical, meaning that it is repeated over and over again. The design process is also iterative, meaning that it is repeated over and over again at any level of the process as needed.\nWhy is iteration important? Iteration is important because it allows engineers to improve their designs. No one gets it right the first time. Engineers will make mistakes and will need to go back and fix them. Each time back through the design process is called an iteration. The more iterations that are done, the better the design will be.\nHow many iterations are needed? The number of iterations needed depends on the problem. Some problems can be solved in a few iterations, while others may take many iterations. When dealing with large problems, it is important to break the problem down into smaller problems that can be solved in a few iterations. This is called decomposition. Decomposition is the process of breaking a large problem into smaller problems that can be solved individually. By combining the solutions to the smaller problems, the solution to the larger problem can be found.\nHow do you know when to stop iterating? When the problem is solved, you can stop iterating. Every teams definition of \u0026ldquo;solved\u0026rdquo; will be different. Some teams may be satisfied with a design that meets the minimum requirements. Other teams may want to go above and beyond the minimum requirements. It is important to have a clear definition of what \u0026ldquo;solved\u0026rdquo; means for your team. This should be written down in the first step of the design process.\nWhat would an example iteration look like? An example iteration is shown below. The design process is repeated over and over again until the problem is solved.\nProblem: The robot does not drive straight well enough to park on the charging station.\nIdentify the Problem The robot does not drive straight well enough to park on the charging station. Research The robot is not driving straight because the wheels are not turning at the same speed. Brainstorm The robot should use a gyro sensor to measure the angle of the robot. The robot should use a PID controller to adjust the speed of the motors to keep the robot straight. Create a Prototype The robot uses a gyro sensor to measure the angle of the robot. The robot uses a PID controller to adjust the speed of the motors to keep the robot straight. Test the Prototype The robot drives straight enough to park on the charging station, but loses traction when the station is angled. Communicate the Results The robot drives straight enough to park on the charging station. Repeat Go back to step 1. New Problem: The robot loses traction when the charging station is angled. "
