      <title>5.1 What are Pneumatics?</title>

      <description>Originally discovered by the ancient Greeks, pneumatics is the study of air pressure. Pneumatics is a branch of fluid power that uses compressed air to power actuators. Pneumatic actuators are used to move mechanical parts, such as valves, cylinders, and other devices. Pneumatic systems are used in a wide variety of applications, including robotics, manufacturing, and construction.
In FRC teams typically use cylinders to extend and retract a piston. This can be used to move a mechanism in a linear direction, or to rotate a mechanism.</description>

      <description>Pneumatic components are the parts of a pneumatic system that use compressed air to do work. There are many different types of pneumatic components. The most common pneumatic components are shown in the table below:
   Component Description Image Vendor Link(s)     Solenoid A solenoid is a valve that uses an electric current to open and close. It is used to control the flow of air in a pneumatic system.</description>

      <description>Pneumatics are powerful and can be dangerous if not used properly. This section will cover the safety rules and guidelines for pneumatics. As is the case with all safety rules, they are not meant to be restrictive. They are meant to be guidelines to help keep you safe. If you have any questions about the safety rules, please ask your mentor or coach.
Safety Rules  Never use compressed air to propel a projectile.</description>

      <description>Setting up a pneumatic system can be a daunting task. This section will cover the basics of setting up a pneumatic system. It will cover the basics of the components and how to connect them. It will also cover the basics of how to setup the compressor and the PCM and how to test the system.
Gatherings the Components The first step in setting up a pneumatic system is to gather the components.</description>

      <title>5.5 Pneumatic Control</title>
      <link>https://frczero.org/pneumatics/pneumatic-control/</link>

      <description>Pneumatic control is the process of controlling the flow of air to the pneumatic system. This is done by using solenoids to control cylinders of various shapes and sizes. All of the cylinders are controlled using the same basic hardware. At a minimum, if you have followed along you should have a compressor, a pressure switch, a release valve, and a solenoid. The solenoid is the only part of the system that is controlled by the robot.</description>

      <description>Sometimes things dont work as expected. This section will help you troubleshoot your pneumatic system.
Common Issues with Pneumatics  Pneumatic solenoids are not working   Check the solenoid wiring.  Is the solenoid wired to the PCM? Is the solenoid wired to the correct channel? Is the solenoid wired with the correct polarity?   Check the solenoid.  Is the solenoid plugged in? Is the solenoid broken?  If using a manifold, check the manifold for a proper seal If its a double solenoid, check they are both not firing at the same time     Check the PCM.</description>
