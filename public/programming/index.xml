      <description>What is programming? Programming is the process of designing, writing, testing, debugging, and maintaining the source code of computer programs. It is a set of instructions that tell a computer what to do and how to do it.
Programming languages are the languages used to write the source code of programs. There are many programming languages, each with its own syntax, structure, and rules. The four most popular programming languages used in FRC include Python, Java, C++, and LabVIEW.</description>
